,Abstract
0,"Soybean is one of the main sources of oil worldwide. Salinity severely affect its yield. GmSIN1 is a NAC transcription factor coding gene. Its overexpression (OE) transgenic lines greatly improved the yield in both common and saline fields. This study focuses on founding changes genes between GmSIN1 OE transgenic seedlings and control seedlings under salt stress or non-salt stress conditions. Illumina Solexa sequencing platform was used for the comparative analysis of transcriptome profiles in the roots and leaves of GmSIN1 OE transgenic seedlings and WEI6823 (control) seedlings under mock or 150 mM NaCl treatment for 6 hrs. Overall design: A total of 8 samples was analyzed. Two soybean genotypes, 2 treatment and 2 biological replicates per condition were used."
1,The goal of this study is to obtain the circadian transcriptome of soybean leaf and derive the time-indicating genes for the molecular timetable analysis. Overall design: Soybean unifoliolate mRNA profiles of 11-day-old Williams82 seedlings under the circadian condition were generated by HiSeq in triplicates
2,"Tissue culture is a major method for plant regeneration and for production of transgenic plants. Thus far, our knowledge of the dynamic epigenomic during tissue culture is limited. In this study, we generated epigenomes from nine different stages throughout the tissue culture process and found significant genome-wide increases of DNA methylation throughout the soybean genome. This change mostly happens in CHH (H = A, T, C) context and targets transposable elements (TEs). Subsequent analyses of corresponding transcriptomes and small RNA distributions indicate that it is associated with high activity of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. These results provide important insights into the function of a dynamic epigenome throughout tissue culture and extends our understanding of epigenome-wide reprogramming of the DNA methylome in plants. Overall design: Five samples throughout specific stages of tissue culture were analyzed in tripiicate for changes in DNA methylation, RNA expression and smalL RNA abundance"
3,"Cultivated soybean has domesticated in China for a long history, and there are several significant phenotypic differences between wild and cultivated soybeans. Seed of cultivar is generally larger than wild soybean, therefore here we comprehensively analyzed transcriptomes of thirteen soybean accessions seeds including seven wild soybeans and six landraces through applying strand-specific RNA sequencing. Differential expressed genes related seed weight were identified, some of them were known to be associated with seed development in Arabidopsis. Noncoding RNAs are known to play important roles in plant development, and we profiled the expression pattern of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in cultivated and wild soybean seeds. We have identified 1,251 long intergenic noncoding RNA, 243 intronic RNA and 81 antisense lncRNA, transcriptional levels of a number of lncRNAs were significantly different between cultivated and wild soybeans, suggesting that lncRNA may be involved in soybean seed development. Overall design: High-depth paired-end RNA-seq from wild and cultivated soybeans"

96,A transcriptome analysis of soybean seeds harvested at different developing stages (between stage 7.1 and stage 9) was carried out to understand the molecular events occuring during the acquisition of seed longevity during maturation. Overall design: RNAseq from developing Glycine max seeds from stage 7.1 (mid-seedfilling) to final maturation
97,A parastic cluster of soybean and dodder was cultivated. Whether there is herbivory-induced systemic signaling from Cuscuta to the host plants were studied.
98,"WRKY transcriptional factors play important roles in response to various abiotic stresses. In this study, we demonstrate that inserting a copy of soybean WRKY54 driven by a constitutive promoter of CMP (cestrum yellow leaf curling virus) or a drought induced promoter of RD29a, improves drought tolerance in transgenic soybean plants. GmWRKY54 is a transcriptional activator and regulates expressions of large numbers of stress-related genes. Using a GO enrichment toolkit, we found that GmWRKY54 up-regulated GO terms related to transcriptional regulator and gene expression and down-regulated GO terms related to photosynthesis and membrane. Using a co-expression network analysis, we find that dozens of genes are negatively co-expressing with photosynthetic genes. These genes are related to ABA signaling pathway, Ca2+ signaling pathway and transcriptional factors. Transgenic plants confer drought tolerance through improving stomatal closure, reducing transpiration rate and reducing membrane damage during water deficit. GmWRKY54 activates expression of these ABA or Ca2+ signaling-related genes, which finally regulates stomatal aperture. GmWRKY54 binds to the promoter regions of genes encoding an ABA receptor (PYL8-1), two calcium dependent protein kinase (CPK3-1 and CPK3-2), a CBL (Calcineurin B-like protein) interacting protein kinase (CIPK11-2), a SnRK family protein kinase and a ferritin, suggesting that they are the direct targets of GmWRKY54. Our study reveals that GmWRKY54 significantly improves drought tolerance in soybean and regulates expression of large numbers of drought-related genes, suggesting that GmWRKy54 maybe a master regulator of drought response. Overall design: Three transgenic soybean samples, A004A, A005B and B010C and the control plants (null) were chosen for RNA-seq. Both well-water samples and dehydrated samples were analyzed."
99,"We investigated soybean seed development because (1) soybean seeds are a major source of food and fuel, (2) soybean seeds have been an excellent system for studying the basic processes controlling seed development for over three decades, and (3) new soybean genomic resources, including the sequence of the soybean genome and the gene expression profiles for all seed compartments, tissues, and cell types, can be used to gain new insights into the regulatory processes required for seed differentiation. We sequenced messenger RNA populations of specific soybean seed compartments, which will provide new insights into gene expression that are important for “making a soybean seed.” Overall design: Three compartments of the mid-maturation (B1) stage of the soybean seeds were analyzed. Three biological replicates were collected for each compartment."
100,"Flavonoids are an important class of plant specialized metabolites. They have various biological functions, including antioxidant action and interaction with other organisms.  For example, daidzein and genistein are required for symbiosis with rhizobia, and daidzein is a precursor of glyceollin. Previous studies showed that isoflavonoids were increased by the inoculation of fungi in soybean. However, transcriptomic and metabolomic change by fungal inoculation has not yet been investigated. In this study, we investigated the metabolic response of fungal-fermented soybean seedlings at the transcriptome and metabolome levels."
101,"Total RNAs were extracted from internodes and roots of 18 day-after-germination soybean plants, and the expression levels of the genes that encode xylem sap associated peptides or proteins were analyzed."
102,"Soybean (Glycine max L.; 2n=20) is one of the world's most important leguminous crops and a major source of proteins, oils, and other physiologically active substances. In Japan, soybean is a crop that has been eaten from ancient times, as a valuable source of fermented products such as miso, soy sauce, and natto, and non-fermented products such as tofu and soymilk. In order to facilitate improvement of Japanese soybean cultivars, a large-scale analysis of an elite soybean cultivar Enrei has been initiated. The genome project aims to (1) determine a draft genome sequence of cultivated Enrei using next-generation sequencing technology, (2) characterize the genome by comparative analysis with the completely sequenced soybean cultivar Williams 82, and (3) elucidate the genes involved in many agronomic traits that can be used for improvement of Japanese soybean cultivars."

106,"Chitin, an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine polymer, is a component of fungal cell walls and arthropod exoskeletons. This polymer can be used used as a fertilizer or soil amendment to enhance crop growth. However, the polymeric chitin is difficult to handle due to its insolubility in water. We recently developed chitin nanofiber (CNF), which has a highly uniform structure of 10-20 nm thickness and shows high dispersing ability in water. In this study, the transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq was conducted to elucidate global changes in gene expression in shoots and roots of CNF-treated soybeans (Glycine max)."

110,"RNA-sequencing of twelve treatments: two cultivars (Embrapa 45 and BR 4), two oxygen conditions [fully aerobic state (normoxy) and hypoxic], and three treatment sampling times (0.5h, 4h, and 28h). For each of twelve treatments, equimolar quantities of purified total RNA from roots of twelve plants [three biological replicates (four plantlets per replicate)] were pooled to result one library. After processing the twelve libraries (poly-A purification, fractionation, cDNA synthesis using random primers, and ligation to bar-coded adapters), fragments of 150–250 pb were isolated and multiplexed, resulting one sequencing library (a pooled of equimolar quantities from twelve initial libraries; each library with a specific barcode for further bioinformatic discrimination). Sequencing library was used to produce clusters for a 1 x 100 bp single end-sequencing run into one lane on a flow cell for sequencing in a Hi-Seq 2000 (Illumina)."
111,"GmMYB176, an R1 MYB transcription factor regulates isoflavonoid biosynthesis in soybean. In the current experiment, GmMYB176 was silenced (GmMYB176-Si) or overexpressed (GmMYB176-OE) in soybean hairy roots and their effect on transcriptome was studied. RNA-Seq analyses of GmMYB176-Si and GmMYB176-OE along with control non-transformed soybean hairy roots revealed that alteration of gene expression of GmMYB176 affects gene regulation of hundreds of genes in soybean."
112,Establishment of the nitrogen-fixing nodulation symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia requires plant-wide reprogramming to allow infection and development of nodules. To identify gene expression changes that occur in response to nodulation or in response to nodulation signals we used an RNAseq based transcriptomics approach.
113,We used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to capture soybean seed compartments and profiled the transcriptomes of several compartments using next-generation sequencing.  We profiled the transcriptomes of the embryo-proper and the suspensor region from globular stage embryos and the seed coat parenchyma layer of early maturation stage seeds using the Illumina GAIIx system. Overall design: Illumina sequencing of transcripts from laser-captured embryo proper and suspensor of globular stage embryo and seed coat parenchyma layer of the early maturation stage seed.
114,"We report the genome-wide transcriptome of soybean seeds across several stages of seed development and the entire life cycle using Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. Specifically, we profiled whole seeds containing globular-stage, heart-stage, cotyledon-stage, early maturation-stage, mid-maturation-stage, and late-maturation-stage embryos. We also profiled dry soybean seeds, and vegetative and reproductive tissues including leaves, roots, stems, seedlings, and floral buds. Overall design: IIllumina sequencing of transcripts from whole seeds at five stages of seed development (globular, heart, cotyledon, early-maturation, mid-maturation, late-maturation, dry), and vegetative (leaves, roots, stems, seedlings) and reproductive (floral buds) tissues."
115,"How epigenetics is involved in the transition from seed maturation to seed germination largely remains elusive. To uncover the possible role of epigenetics in gene expression during the transition from seed maturation to seed germination in soybean, the transcriptome of cotyledons from four stages of soybean seed maturation and germination, including mid-late maturation, late maturation, seed dormancy and seed germination, were profiled by Illumina sequencing. For the genes that are quantitatively regulated at the four stages, two antagonistic epigenetic marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, together with the binding of RNA polymerase II, were investigated at the four stages by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). For 10 out of 16 genes examined, the relative enrichment of histone modification marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) and RNA polymerase II binding on their promoter regions correlates well with their relative expression levels at four stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetics in transcriptional regulation. A striking finding is that seed germination-specific genes start to show open chromatin (H3K4me3) during late seed maturation although their transcripts do not accumulate, which is further supported by RNA polymerase II binding. Together, our results provide the first evidence that seed germination genes can be primed for transcription (open chromatin and RNA polymerase II binding) during seed maturation, highlighting that the transition from seed maturation to seed germination starts at late seed maturation stages at both the genetic and epigenetic levels. Overall design: Illumina sequencing of transcripts from cotyledons of mid-maturation (B1 stage) and late maturation (AA1 stage) seeds, whole dry seeds, and cotyledons of seedlings six days after imbibition."
116,"Two high throughput transcript sequencing methods, Digital Gene Expression (DGE) Tag Profiling and RNA-Seq, were used to compare the transcriptional profiles in wild-type (cv. Clark standard, CS) and a mutant (cv. Clark glabrous, i.e., trichomeless or hairless, CG) soybean isoline that carries the dominant P1 allele. DGE data and RNA-Seq data were mapped to the cDNAs (Glyma models) predicted from the reference soybean genome, Williams 82. Extending the model length by 250 bp at both ends resulted in significantly more matches of authentic DGE tags indicating that many of the predicted gene models are prematurely truncated at the 5' and 3' UTRs. The genome-wide comparative study of the transcript profiles of the wild-type versus mutant line revealed a number of differentially expressed genes. One highly-expressed gene, Glyma04g35130, in wild-type soybean was of interest as it has high homology to the cotton gene GhRDL1 gene that has been identified as being involved in cotton fiber initiation and is a member of the BURP protein family. Sequence comparison of Glyma04g35130 among Williams 82 with our sequences derived from CS and CG isolines revealed various SNPs and indels including addition of one nucleotide C in the CG and insertion of ~60 bp in the third exon of CS that causes a frameshift mutation and premature truncation of peptides in both lines as compared to Williams 82. Overall design: 2 samples examined: Clark standard (wild type) and Clark glabrous (soybean hairless mutant)"
117,"Cytosine methylation is an important mechanism for dynamical regulation of gene expression and transposon mobility during plant developmental processes. Recently, the variation of DNA methylation has been described between wild type and DNA methylation-related mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the elaborate representation of soybean DNA methylomes remains lacking. Here, we described the epigenome maps of soybean root, stem, leaf, and cotyledon of developing seed at a single-base resolution. We confirmed the transcription start sites of genes using high-throughput sequencing and reported the DNA methylation patterns in gene and transposon regions. The correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation was revealed through transcriptome sequencing. We found CHH methylation may function in promotion of gene expression and ten cotyledon-preferred genes were identified CHH hypermethylated in cotyledon. Small RNA library sequencing showed that DNA methylation was enhanced by small RNAs not by strand-specific way, and the variation of DNA methylation between the organs was highly related with expression of small RNAs. Overall design: mRNA-Seq of roots, stems, leaves, and cotyledons of developing seeds"
118,"Seeds are comprised of three majors parts of distinct parental origin: the seed coat, embryo, and endosperm.  The maternally-derived seed coat is important for nurturing and protecting the seeds during development.  By contrast, the embryo and the endosperm are derived from a double fertilization event, where one sperm fertilizes the egg to form the diploid zygote and the other sperm fertilizes the central cell to form the triploid endosperm.  Each seed parts undergo distinct developmental programs during seed development.  What methylation changes occurring in the different seed parts, if any, remains unknown. To uncover the possible role of DNA methylation in different parts of the seed, we characterized the methylome of three major parts of an early maturation stage seed: seed coat, embryonic cotyledons, and embryonic axis using Illumina sequencing. Overall design: Illumina sequencing of bisulfite-converted genomic DNA, transcripts, and small RNAs from three parts of an early maturation stage seed: seed coat (EM-SC), embryonic cotyledons (EM-COT), and embryonic axis (EM-AX)."
119,The epigenomics approaches presented here provide the first comprehensive study of the patterns and heritability of methylation variants in a complex genetic population over multiple generations paving the way for understanding how methylation variants contribute to phenotypic variation. Overall design: MethylC-Seq and RNA-Seq data collected from Glycine max leaves of two parental lines of a RIL population and two individual RILs. Additionally gDNA-Seq was performed on the two parental lines [SRA060034].
120,"To understand the genetic mechanisms involved in the functional transition of cotyledons from non-photosynthetic storage tissue to metabolically active photosynthetic tissue during soybean seedling development, we constructed seven different RNA-Seq libraries using cotyledons from each developmental stage separately. Analysis of RNA-Seq data from different developmental stages revealed the differential expression of many genes including transcription factors. In this study, we focused on NAC and YABBY transcription factors which showed a conspicuous expression pattern during soybean seedling development. Their expression gradually increases from stage 1 to stage 4 of soybean germinating cotyledons. The highest level of expression was found at stage 4. Then it gradually decreased as the germinating cotyledons develop a mature seedling. We investigated the differential expression of NAC and YABBY regulated genes between stage 3 (before the functional transition) and stage 6 (after the functional transition) using our RNA-Seq data. Based on our RNA-Seq data, we found that 10 genes are up-regulated and 21 genes are down-regulated by NAC transcription factor. Similarly we found that 19 genes are up-regulated and 27 genes are down-regulated by YABBY transcription factor. Overall design: High-throughput sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (RNA-Seq) was performed on seven developmental stages of soybean seedlings, with two biological replicates per stage."
121,"To understand gene expression networks leading to functional properties and compositional traits of the soybean seed, we have undertaken a detailed examination of soybean seed development from a few days post-fertilization to the mature seed using Illumina high-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). RNA was sequenced from seven different stages of seed development, yielding between 12 million and 78 million sequenced transcripts. These have been aligned to the 79,000 gene models predicted from the soybean genome recently sequenced by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. Over one hundred gene models were identified with high expression exclusively in young seed stages, starting at just four days after fertilization. These were annotated as being related to many basic components and processes such as histones and proline-rich proteins. Genes involved with some storage proteins such as glycinin and beta-conglycinin had their highest expression levels at the stages of largest fresh weight, confirming previous knowledge that these storage products are being rapidly accumulated before the seed begins the desiccation process. Other gene models showed high expression in the dry, mature seeds, perhaps indicating the preparation of pathways needed later, in the early stages of imbibition. Many highly-expressed gene models at the dry seed stage are, as expected, annotated as hydrophilic proteins associated with low water conditions, such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and dehydrins, which help preserve the cellular structures and nutrients within the seed during desiccation. Hundreds of transcription factors with notable expression in at least one stage of seed development were also identified and examined. Results from a second biological replicate demonstrate high reproducibility of these data. Overall design: High-throughput sequencing using Illumina Genome Analyzer II and Illumina HiSeq 2000 (RNA-Seq) was performed on seven stages of soybean seeds, with two biological replicates per stage."
122,"Microbe associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered immunity (MTI) is an important component of the plant innate immunity response to invading pathogens. Although several MTI responses can be measured in different plant species, their magnitude is likely plant-species specific and even cultivar specific. In this work, we show that the variation in gene expression, either under untreated or treated conditions, is inherited. In addition, genes with potential additive and non-additive effects were identified in two mapping lines, several of these with a potential function in the control of the innate immunity. Likewise, we observed that some genes differentially expressed across the parental and mapping lines showed different DNA methylation patterns. Finally, a gene regulatory module analysis identified key networks that likely control soybean innate immunity. The data presented represent the basis for further functional analysis that can lead to a better understanding of the soybean innate immunity response. Overall design: RNA-Seq data collected from Glycine max leaves treated with MAMPs of two parental lines of a RIL population and two individual RILs."
123,Virus Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) was used to silence the expression of soybean Replication Protein 3 (GmRPA3). RNAseq was used to compare gene expression in GmRPA3 silenced and empty vector treated plants.

Three to four biological replicates were collected for each compartment."
126,"Soybean (Glycine max) seeds are an important source of seed storage compounds, including protein, oil, and sugar used for food, feed, chemical, and biofuel production. We assessed detailed temporal transcriptional and metabolic changes in developing soybean embryos to gain a systems biology view of developmental and metabolic changes and to identify potential targets for metabolic engineering. Two major developmental and metabolic transitions were captured enabling identification of potential metabolic engineering targets specific to seed filling and to desiccation. The first transition involved a switch between different types of metabolism in dividing and elongating cells. The second transition involved the onset of maturation and desiccation tolerance during seed filling and a switch from photoheterotrophic to heterotrophic metabolism. Clustering analyses of metabolite and transcript data revealed clusters of functionally related metabolites and transcripts active in these different developmental and metabolic programs. The gene clusters provide a resource to generate predictions about the associations and interactions of unknown regulators with their targets based on    guilt-by-association    relationships. The inferred regulators also represent potential targets for future metabolic engineering of relevant pathways and steps in central carbon and nitrogen metabolism in soybean embryos and drought and desiccation tolerance in plants. Overall design: Total mRNA profiles of 10 time course samples of Soybean developing embryos with three replicates per sample were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000"

128,"The seed coat is a vital tissue for directing nutrient supply to the embryo and cotyledons during development. By forming a sucrose gradient, the seed coat promotes transport of sugars from source leaves to seeds, thereby increasing sink strength. Understanding how gene regulation in sink tissue is altered by climate change factors will help elucidate the role these genes play in determining yield. This project aims to determine how elevated temperature, drought and ozone alter gene expression in the seed coat. Overall this study discovered high abundance seed coat specific genes, which may be candidates for functional genomic analysis in the future."

130,"Intercropping is a sustainable agricultural practice widely used around the world for enhancing resource use efficiency. However, short crops often grow in shade condition underneath the canopy of tall crops. Soybean is one of the most important oil crops and usually is planted in intercropping patterns. However, little is known about the acclimation responses of soybean leaves to shade in intercropping condition at the transcriptome level."
131,"Phytophthora root and stem rot (PRR) of soybean, caused by Phytophthora sojae, is effectively controlled by Rps genes in soybean. Rps genes are race-specific, yet the mechanism of resistance, as well as susceptibility, remains largely unclear. Taking advantage of RNA-seq technology, we sequenced the transcriptomes of 10 near isogenic lines (NIL), each with a unique Rps gene, and the recurrent susceptible parent 'Williams'. A total of 4330 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in 'Williams' while 2075 to 5499 DEGs were identified in each NIL. Comparisons between the NILs and 'Williams' allowed classification of two major groups of DEGs of interest: incompatible reaction associated genes (IRAGs) and compatible reaction associated genes (CRAGs). Hierarchical cluster analysis divided NILs into three clusters: Cluster I (Rps1-a), Cluster II (Rps1-b, 1-c and 1-k) and Cluster III (Rps3-a, 3-b, 3-c, 4, 5, and 6). Heatmap analysis, along with GO analysis suggested that the diversity of clusters for NILs were likely due to variation of the number of DEGs and the intensity of gene expression, rather than functional differentiation. Further analysis suggested that transcription factors might play pivotal role in determination of the cluster pattern, and that WRKY family were strongly associated with incompatible reactions. Analysis of IRAGs and CRAGs with putative functions suggested that the regulation of many phytohormone signaling pathways were associated with incompatible or compatible interactions with potential crosstalk between each other. As such, our study provides an in depth view of both incompatible and compatible interactions between soybean and P. sojae, which provides further insight into the mechanisms involved in host-pathogen interactions. Overall design: 22 samples were sequenced, 11 inoculated with P. sojae, the other 11 were mock-inoculated"

We identified genes exhibiting daily oscillation patterns under different photoperiod treatments, genes under control of maturity loci (E1, E2, E3 and E5), and genes that constitute the soybean flowering gene network. Overall design: RNA sequencing analysis was performed using Williams 82, Clark and four NILs in Clark that are polymorphic for E loci (E1, E2, E3 and E5), as well as the wild soybean Glycine soja, under different photoperiod treatments."
138,"The sustainability of soybean growth is being significantly affected by increases in ozone concentration. Current increases in ozone concentrations have decreased soybean yields by ~15-25%. Furthermore, soybean plants differentiate many more floral buds than survive to mature pods. Studies have found that pod set can be as low as 20-40% under normal conditions. Generally, it is assumed that abortion rates can vary based on location in the canopy, source-sink relationship, hormone levels, shade, water status. However, the genetic controls of flower and pod abscission in soybean are largely unknown, and the effects of ozone on flower and pod abscission have not been thoroughly investigated. Due to the negative effects of ozone on yield, it is of critical importance to understand the genetic control behind soybean abortion. The objective of this study is to understand the gene expression patterns underpinning flower and pod abscission rates in soybean exposed to elevated ozone concentrations."
139,"The plant cell wall performs a number of essential functions including providing shape to many different cell types and serving as a defense against potential pathogens. The net pattern mutation creates breaks in the seed coat of soybean (Glycine max) because of ruptured cell walls. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the seed coat transcriptome from three stages of immature seed development in two pairs of isolines with normal or defective seed coat phenotypes due to the net pattern. The genome-wide comparative study of the transcript profiles of these isolines revealed 364 differentially expressed genes in common between the two varieties that were further divided into different broad functional categories. Genes related to cell wall processes accounted for 19% of the differentially expressed genes in the middle developmental stage of 100-200 mg seed weight. Within this class, the cell wall proline-rich and glycine-rich protein genes were highly differentially expressed in both genetic backgrounds. Other genes that showed significant expression changes in each of the isoline pairs at the 100-200 mg seed weight stage were xylem serine proteinase, fasciclin-related genes, auxin and stress response related genes, TRANSPARENT TESTA 1 (TT1) and other transcription factors. The mutant appears to shift the timing of either the increase or decrease in the levels of some of the transcripts.  The analysis of these data sets reveals the physiological changes that the seed coat undergoes during the formation of the breaks in the cell wall. Overall design: Examination of soybean isolines in two different genetic background at three different seed weight stages: Seed coats of Clark standard (CS, wild type) &amp; Clark defective (CD, seed coat mutant), Harosoy Standard (HS) &amp; Harosoy defective (HD) at 50-100mg, 100-200mg and 400-500mg."

141,"Genetic/genome diversity underlying variation in seed oil composition and content among soybean varieties is largely attributed to differences in transcript sequences and/or transcript accumulation of oil production related genes in seeds. Discovery and analysis of sequence and expression variations in these genes will accelerate soybean oil quality improvement. In an effort to identify these variations, we sequenced the transcriptomes of soybean seeds from nine lines varying in oil composition and/or total oil content. Our results showed that 69,338 distinct transcripts from 32,885 annotated genes were expressed in seeds. A total of 8,037 transcript expression polymorphisms and 50,485 transcript sequence polymorphisms (48,792 SNPs and 1,693 small Indels) were identified among the lines.  Effects of the transcript polymorphisms on their encoded protein sequences and functions were predicted. The studies also provided independent evidence that the lack of FAD2-1A gene activity and a non-synonymous SNP in the coding sequence of FAB2C caused elevated oleic acid and stearic acid levels in soybean lines M23 and FAM94-41, respectively. As a proof-of-concept, we developed an integrated RNA-seq and bioinformatics approach to identify and functionally annotate transcript polymorphisms, and demonstrated its high effectiveness for discovery of genetic and transcript variations that result in altered oil quality traits. The collection of transcript polymorphisms coupled with their predicted functional effects will be a valuable asset for further discovery of genes, gene variants, and functional markers to improve soybean oil quality.

143,"Background The homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) transcription factor family is one of the largest plant specific superfamilies, and includes genes with roles in modulation of plant growth and response to environmental stresses. Many HD-Zip genes are characterized in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and members of the family are being investigated for abiotic stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and cucumber (Cucmis sativus). Findings in these species suggest HD-Zip genes as high priority candidates for crop improvement. Results In this study we have identified members of the HD-Zip gene family in soybean cv. ''Williams 82'', and characterized their expression under dehydration and salt stress. Homology searches with BLASTP and Hidden Markov Model guided sequence alignments identified 101 HD-Zip genes in the soybean genome. Phylogeny reconstruction coupled with domain and gene structure analyses using soybean, Arabidopsis, rice, grape (Vitis vinifera), and Medicago truncatula homologues enabled placement of these sequences into four previously described subfamilies. Of the 101 HD-Zip genes identified in soybean, 88 exist as whole-genome duplication-derived gene pairs, indicating high retention of these genes following polyploidy in Glycine ~10 Mya. The HD-Zip genes exhibit ubiquitous expression patterns across 24 conditions that include 17 tissues of soybean. An RNA-Seq experiment performed to study differential gene expression at 0, 1, 6 and 12 hr soybean roots under dehydration and salt stress identified 20 differentially expressed (DE) genes. Several of these DE genes are orthologs of genes previously reported to play a role under abiotic stress, implying conservation of HD-Zip gene functions across species. Screening of HD-Zip promoters identified transcription factor binding sites that are overrepresented in the DE genes under both dehydration and salt stress, providing further support for the role of HD-Zip genes in abiotic stress responses. Conclusions We provide a thorough description of soybean HD-Zip genes, and identify potential candidates with probable roles in dehydration and salt stress. Expression profiles generated for all soybean genes, under dehydration and salt stress, at four time points, will serve as an important resource for the soybean research community, and will aid in understanding plant responses to abiotic stress. Overall design: We sequenced mRNA from soybean cv.

147,"Melatonin is a well-known agent that plays multiple roles in animals. Its possible function in plants is less clear. In the present study, we tested the effect of melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) on soybean growth and development. Both spraying of leaves and seed-coating with melatonin significantly promoted soybean growth as judged from leaf size and plant height. This enhancement was also observed in soybean production and their fatty acid content. Melatonin increased pod number, seed number and seed weight. However, the 100-seed weight was not influenced by melatonin application. Melatonin also improved soybean tolerance to salt and drought stresses. Transcriptome analysis revealed that melatonin up-regulated the expression of many genes and alleviated the inhibitory effects of salt stress on gene expressions. Further detailed analysis of the affected pathways documents that melatonin likely achieved its promotional roles in soybean through enhancement of genes involved in cell division, photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and ascorbate metabolism. Our results demonstrate that melatonin has significant potential for improving of soybean growth and seed production. Further study should uncover more about the molecular mechanisms of melatonin’s function in soybeans and other crops. Overall design: Four different treatments were chosen, water, salt, 100µM melatonin and salt plus 100µM melatonin. The comparison of salt/melatonin-treated sample versus water-treated sample reveals salt or melatonin induced transcriptome changes. The comparison of melatonin plus salt treated sample versus salt-treated sample reveals melatonin induced changes when salt exists."

151,"Phytophthora root and stem rot (PRR) caused by Phytophthora sojae Kaufm. &amp; Gerd. is one of the most damaging diseases of soybean and management is principally done by planting cultivars with race-specific resistance (Rps genes). A novel Rps gene was identified in the South Korean landrace PI 399073 and mapped to a region on chromosome 13. The objective of this study was to identify tightly linked molecular markers to facilitate its introduction into high yielding adapted cultivars. Resistance to P. sojae isolate OH25 was evaluated with eight separate Williams (rps8/rps8) x PI 399073 (Rps8/Rps8) populations, of which the phenotypic ratios were highly skewed. In a graphical genotype generated from three Williams x PI 399073 BC4F2 populations, Rps8 and resistance to P. sojae isolate Butmu was associated with a 2.23 Mbp region on chromosome 13. Next generation sequencing was subsequently used to assemble ~90% of the 2.23 Mbp in PI 399073."
152,"Oxidative stress caused by ground level ozone is a major contributor to yield loss in a number of important crop plants.  Soybean (Glycine max) is especially ozone sensitive, and research into its response to oxidative stress is limited.  To better understand the genetic response in soybean to oxidative stress, an RNA-seq analysis of two soybean cultivars was performed comparing an ozone intolerant cultivar and an ozone resistant cultivar after being exposed to ozone.  A cursory analysis of the transcriptome data revealed differences between cultivars in the expression levels of genes previously implicated in oxidative stress responses, indicating unique cultivar-specific responses.  An examination of the timing of gene responses over the course of ozone exposure showed expression of cuticle wax genes in the intolerant line over all sampled time points, whereas the tolerant line only expressed this pathway in the first time point.  The ozone tolerant cultivar has a thicker leaf structure and we believe this lends a passive benefit to the plant which the intolerant cultivar is attempting to supplement via cuticle wax synthesis.  These results suggest that differences in genetic responses work in concert with physiological differences to explain differences in ozone tolerance between soybean cultivars. Overall design: 16 total samples.  8 control, 8 at high ozone, 4 time points (30 minute increments starting 5 hours after introduction of ozone) .  Replicates were pooled at extraction."

154,"Research conducted, including the rationale: Weeds reduce yield in soybeans through incompletely defined mechanisms. The effects of weeds on the soybean transcriptome were evaluated in field conditions during four separate gR1.fastqing seasons. Methods: RNASeq data were collected from 6 biological samples of soybeans gR1.fastqing with or without weeds. Weed species and the methods to maintain weed free controls varied between years to mitigate treatment effects and to allow detection of general soybeans weed responses.  Key results: Soybean plants were not visibly nutrient or water stressed. We identified 55 consistently down-regulated genes in weedy plots. Many of the down-regulated genes were heat shock genes. Fourteen genes were consistently up-regulated. Several transcription factors including a PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-like gene (PIF3) were included among the up-regulated genes. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated roles for increased oxidative stress and jasmonic acid signaling responses during weed stress. Main conclusion: The relationship of this weed-induced PIF3 gene to genes involved in shade avoidance responses in arabidopsis provide evidence that this gene may be important in the response of soybean to weeds. These results suggest the weed-induced PIF3 gene will be a target for manipulating weed tolerance in soybean. Overall design: Samples were collected from two treatments (Control and Weedy) with six biological replicates (2008, 2009, and twop each for 2010 and 2011) for each treatment."
155,"We determined the molecular basis of three soybean lines that vary in seed coat color at the R locus which is thought to encode a MYB transcription factor.  RM55-rm is homozygous for a mutable allele (rm) that specifies black and brown striped seeds; RM30-R* is a stable black revertant isoline derived from the mutable line; and RM38-r has brown seed coats due to a recessive r allele shown to translate a truncated MYB protein. Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated  RM55-rm line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated TgmR*) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the R locus, Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by R was expressed at only very low levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-R* line, it upregulated expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (ANS2, ANS3) to promote the synthesis of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-R* revertant also carried the 13 kb TgmR* insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13kb TgmR* element. As determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the TgmR* sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-R* than in the mutable RM55-rm progenitor line. The stabilized and more methylated RM30-R* revertant line apparently lacks effective binding of a transposae to its subterminal repeats, thus allowing intron splicing to proceed resulting in sufficient MYB protein to stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats. In this regard, the TgmR* element in soybean resembles McClintock’s Spm-suppressible and change-of-state alleles of maize. This comparison explains the opposite effects of the TgmR* element on intron splicing of the MYB gene in which it resides depending on the methylation state of the element. Overall design: Differential RNA expression of anthocyanin pathway genes in the seed coats of two seed color lines: RM30-R* (black) and RM38-r (brown). The multiple gene expression analysis  was performed at five different stages of seed development which were chosen based on the fresh weight (fwt) of entire seeds: 100-200, 200-300, 300-400 and 400-500 mg with green cotyledons, and a later stage in which seed desiccation had initiated judging by the yellowing of cotyledons and a lower fresh weight of 300-400 mg"

164,"Fusarium oxysporum is one of the most common species causing soybean root rot and seedling blight in the U.S. In a recent study, significant variation in aggressiveness was observed among isolates of F. oxysporum collected from roots in Iowa, ranging from highly pathogenic to weakly or non-pathogenic isolates. In the present work, a RNA-seq-based analysis was used for the first time to investigate the molecular aspect of the interaction of a partially resistant soybean genotype with non-pathogenic/pathogenic isolates of F. oxysporum at 72 and 96 hours post inoculation (hpi). Markedly different gene expression profiles were observed in compatible and incompatible host-pathogen combinations. A peak of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was observed at 72 hpi in soybean roots in response to both isolates, although the number of DEGs was about eight times higher for the pathogenic isolate compared to the non-pathogenic one (1,659 vs. 203 DEGs, respectively). Furthermore, not only the number of genes, but also the magnitude of induction was much greater in response to the pathogenic isolate. This response included a stronger activation of many well-known defense-related genes, and several genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, transcription factors, secondary and sugar metabolism. In addition, 1130 fungal genes were differentially expressed between the F. oxysporum isolates in planta during the infection process. Interestingly, 10% of these genes encode plant cell-wall degrading enzymes, reactive oxygen species-related enzymes and fungal proteins involved in primary metabolic pathways. Such information may be useful in the development of new methods of broadening resistance of soybean to F. oxysporum, including the silencing of important fungal genes, and also to understand the molecular basis of soybean-F. oxysporum interactions. Overall design: Soybean seedlings mRNA profiles inoculated with a non-pathogenic and pathogenic isolates of F. oxysporum and collected at 72 and 96 hpi, were generated using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Control seedlings were also included for each time of inoculation. Three biological replicates were considered for each condition, 18 samples in total."
165,"The soybean aphid, a plant sap sucking insect, is an important soybean pest in the USA causing significant yield losses. The Rag2  gene of soybean provides resistance to soybean aphid biotypes I and II. Transcriptomic  analyses were performed on near isogenic lines (NILs) with the Rag2 allele for aphid resistance or rag2 for susceptibility at the Rag2 locus. Soybeans were infested with soybean aphids and leaves were collected at 0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours after infestation.  RNA were extracted and a high throughput RNA-seq approach was used to examine mRNA expression in Rag2 and rag2 soybean leaves. The expression of ~43,000 genes was detected in both the Rag2 and rag2 leaves. Statistical analysis identified 2361 genes significantly regulated between the resistant and susceptible lines at different times after aphid infestation. Genes found up-regulated in the Rag2 line were annotated as involved in the cell wall, secondary and hormone metabolism, as well as in stress, signaling and transcriptional responses. Genes found up-regulated in the rag2 line were annotated as involved in photosynthesis and carbon metabolism. Interestingly, mRNAs of 2 genes (unknown and mitochondrial protease) located within the Rag2 locus were expressed significantly higher in the  resistant genotype. The expression of the putative NBS-LRR resistant gene present in the Rag2 locus was not different between the two soybean lines. However, another NBL-LRR gene located just at the border of the Rag2 locus was and, therefore, may be involved in the differential resistance to aphid infestation exhibited by the two NIL genotypes analyzed. Overall design: A total of 20 samples was analyzed. Two soybean genotypes, 5 time points and 2 biological replicates per condition were used."
166,"By sequencing 36 cDNA libraries with Illumina technology, we identified genes differentially expressed in soybean plants in response to water deficit and genes that were either up- or down-regulated in different periods of the day. Of 54,175 predicted soybean genes (Glyma v1.1), 35.52% exhibited expression oscillations in a 24 h period. This number increased to 39.23% when plants were submitted to water deficit. Major differences in gene expression were observed in the control plants from late day (ZT16) until predawn (ZT20) periods, indicating that gene expression oscillates during the course of 24 h in normal development. Under water deficit, dissimilarity increased in all time-periods, indicating that the applied stress influenced gene expression. Results suggest that time of day, as well as light and temperature oscillations that occur considerably affect the regulation of water deficit stress response in soybean plants. Overall design: Gene expression analysis of soybean leaves under water deficit in 6 periods of day by sequencing 36 libraries, in triplicate, in Illumina platform."

Methods: mRNA sequencing reads (101SE) were generated in triplicate from five seed developmental stages of 3mlpa and 3MWT soybean line using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Results: A total of 4235 differentially expressed genes, including 512-transcription factor genes were identified. Eighteen biological processes such as apoptosis, glucan metabolism, cellular transport, photosynthesis and 9 transcription factor families including WRKY, CAMTA3 and SNF2 were enriched during seed development. Genes associated with apoptosis, glucan metabolism, and cellular transport showed enhanced expression in early stages of lpa seed development, while those associated with photosynthesis showed decreased expression in late developmental stages. Conclusion: This study provides a global perspective of transcriptomal changes during soybean seed development in 3mlpa mutant. The results suggest that low phtic acid-causing mutations in 3mlpa play a role in inducing and suppressing plant defense responses during early and late stages of seed development, respectively. Overall design: RNA-Seq of five seed developing soybean seeds from mips1/mrp-l/mrp-n triple mutant line (with low phytic acid) and MIPS1/MRP-L/MRP-N non-mutant line (with normal phytic acid).

175,"Soybean is a major crop that provides an important source of protein and oil to humans and animals, but its production can be dramatically decreased by the occurrence of drought stress. Soybeans can survive drought stress if there is a robust and deep root system at the early vegetative growth stage. However, little is known about the genome-wide molecular mechanisms contributing to soybean root system architecture. This study was performed to gain knowledge on transcriptome changes and related molecular mechanisms contributing to soybean root development under water limited conditions."

179,"RNA-seq data from three soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) fast neutron mutants were compared to the cultivar from which they are derived (cv. 'M92-220').  The three mutants include a gnarled trichome mutant (known as R55C01 or FN0175501), a high seed protein mutant (known as R15C01 or FN0171501) and a short petiole architecture mutant (known as 'Christmas tree', 6R44C72 or FN0164472).  Genetic mapping  of the gnarled trichome mutant using whole genome sequence-based bulked segregant analysis identified a 26.6 megabase interval on chromosome 20 that co-segregates with the phenotype. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of the mutant indicated that the chromosome 20 interval included a small structural variant within the coding region of a soybean ortholog (Glyma.20G019300) of Arabidopsis Nck-Associated Protein 1 (NAP1), an important regulator of actin nucleation during trichome morphogenesis. Sequence analysis of the candidate allele revealed multiple rearrangements within the coding region, including two deletions (approximately 1-2 kb each), a translocation, and an inversion. Further analyses revealed that the mutated allele perfectly co-segregated with the phenotype, and a wild-type soybean NAP1 transgene functionally complemented the Arabidopsis nap1 mutant (grl-4). Additionally, mapping and exon sequencing of NAP1 in a spontaneous soybean gnarled trichome mutant (T31) identified a frame shift mutation resulting in a truncation of the coding region. These data indicate that the soybean NAP1 gene is essential for proper trichome development and that the soybean gnarled phenotype resulted from complex structural rearrangements induced by fast neutron mutagenesis at the NAP1 locus"
180,"Phytophthora root and stem rot caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae, is one of the most destructive diseases of soybean. Deploying soybean cultivars carrying race-specific resistance conferred by Rps genes is the most practicalapproach to managing this disease. Previously, two Rps genes, RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 conferring broad spectra of resistance to P. sojae isolates, were identified in a landrace PI 567139B and mapped to a 6.5-cM region on chromosome 3 and a 3.0-cM region on chromosome 16, corresponding to 840 kb and 600 kb of sequences, respectively,of the soybean reference genome. By analyzing ten and nine recombinants defined by genotypic and phenotypic screening of the 826 F2:3 families derived from two reciprocal crosses between the two parental lines of the mapping populations, RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 were further narrowed to a 151-kb region that harbors five genes including three NBS-LRR genes, and a 36-kb region that contains four genes including five NBS-LRR genes, respectively, according to the reference genome. Analysis of expressional changes of these nine genes before and after inoculation with the pathogen suggest that the counterparts of Glyma.03g034600 in the RpsUN1 region and the counterparts of Glyma.16g215200 and Glyma.16g214900 in the RpsUN2 region of PI 567139B may be associated with the resistance to P. sojae. It is also suggested that unequal recombination between different NBS-LRR genes in the mapped regions may have occurred, resulting in the formation of two recombinants with inconsistent genotypes and phenotypes detected by molecular markers within the fine-mapped regions. The haplotypes of genomic regions surrounding RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 in the entire soybean germplasm deposited in the US soybean germplasm collection were analyzed towards a better understanding of the origins of these two novel sources of resistance and screening of effective markers for marker-assisted selectionof these two resistance genes for soybean breeding. Overall design: 2 samples were sequenced, 1 inoculated with P. sojae, the other 1 were mock-inoculated"

182,"Seed germination is important to soybean (Glycine max) growth and development, ultimately affecting soybean yield. A lower seed field emergence has been the main hindrance for breeding soybeans low in phytate. Although this reduction could be overcome by additional breeding and selection, the mechanisms of seed germination in different low phytate mutants remain unknown. In this study, we performed a comparative transcript analysis of two low phytate soybean mutants (TW-1 and TW-1-M), which have the same mutation, a 2 bp deletion in GmMIPS1, but show a significant difference in seed field emergence. Overall design: 18 samples were analyzed in this research, and three replicates were included."

Two near isogenic lines carrying either the Rag5 allele for resistance or the rag5 allele for susceptibility were used for this study. After infestation by biotype 2 aphids, transcriptomic changes in soybean leaf tissues over a two-day period (total 4 time points) was studied using Illumina HiSeq and subsequent high-throughput sequencing analysis pipeline."
186,"Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins are 'histone code readers'. They recognize and bind to epigenetically modified histone H3 'tail'. Here we reported that an Alfin1-like soybean protein, GmPHD6, read H3K4me0/1/2 but not H3K4me3 with the N-terminal instead of the PHD finger. GmPHD6 does not possess transcriptional regulatory ability. Through the PHD finger, GmPHD6 interacts with its co-activator, LHP1-1/2. Using a transgenic hairy root system, we demonstrated that over-expression of GmPHD6 improved stress tolerance in transgenic soybean composites. Perhaps due to the excessive amount of LHP1 compared to that of GmPHD6, over-expression of LHP1-1/2 failed to do so. The integrity of the complex is essential in stress response, for the abrogation of DNA binding activity of GmPHD6 or the decrease of LHP1 content leads to stress sensitivity in soybean. GmPHD6 influences expression of dozens of stress-related genes to confer stress tolerance. Among these genes, we identified three direct targets of GmPHD6, ASR (ABA-stress-ripening induced), CYP71A22 (cytochrome P450) and CYP82C4. Our study reveals significant findings in stress response. GmPHD6 and LHP1 are recruited to H3K4me0/1/2 marks, where several stress-related genes may locate in, to form a transcriptional activation complex. GmPHD6 locates target sites through recognizing the G-rich elements in their promoters; LHP1 enhances expression levels of these targets. Genetically engineering of GmPHD6/LHP1 complex should improve stress tolerance in crop plants. Overall design: Three samples were chosen, GmPHD6 over-expression, GmPHD6 RNAi and the control sample (K599).Downstream genes are defined as the common genes that are up-regulated in GmPHD6-OE sample and down-regulated in RNAi sample."
187,"Purpose: The root hair is a model for understanding evolution of individual cell differentiation programs in plants. We compare the expression of the genes that participate in root hair development between Arabidopsis and other vascular plants to assess the conservation/diversification of the root hair development programs in vascular plants. Methods: We used RNA-Seq, in triplicates, to measure the genome-wide transcription activity of the root-hair cells isolated by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in Arabidopsis (COBL9::GFP transgeneic line, AtRH) and rice (EXPA30::GFP transgenic line, OsRH). We also generated RNA-Seq data, in triplicates, on the Arabidopsis rhd6 WER::GFP and WT WER::GFP by FACS to identify the RHD6-regulating root hair morphogenesis genes (AtRHM). For Arabidopsis, rice, tomato, soybean, cucumber and maize, we used RNA-seq, in triplicates, to measure genome-wide transcription activity of root hair cells filtered by sieves after stirred in liquid nitrogen (HAIR genes). Each sample was trimmed to retain high-quality reads, mapped to the reference genome by TopHat, and quantified by Cufflinks. The number of raw reads of Arabidopsis rhd6 WER::GFP and WT WER::GFP sample was counted by HTSeq and analyzed by edgeR to identify the differentially expressed genes. Results: We defined the root-hair transcriptome in diverse vascular plant species and analyzed the relative conservation/divergence in the expression of a large set of gene families. Overall design: RNA-Seq on the FACS isolated root hair-cells of Arabidopsis COBL9::GFP and rice EXPA30::GFP transgenic lines to get the gene expression of the root-hair cells of Arabidopsis and rice. RNA-Seq on the FACS isolated epidermal cells of Arabidopsis rhd6 WER::GFP and WT WER::GFP transgenic lines to identify the RHD6-regulating root hair genes.

Each measurement includes 3 biological replicates."
188,"Soybean plants that do not produce a sink, such as depodded or male sterile plants, exhibit physiological and morphological changes during the reproductive stages, including increased levels of nitrogen and starch in the leaves and a delayed senescence. To identify transcriptional changes that occur in leaves of sink-limited plants, we used RNAseq to compare gene expression levels in trifoliate leaves from depodded and ms6 male sterile plants and control plants. In sink-limited tissues, we observed a deferral of the expression of senescence-associated genes and a continued high expression of genes associated with the maturity phase of leaf development. We identified GO-terms associated with growth and development and storage protein in sink limited tissues. We also identified that the bHLH. ARFs, and SBP transcription factors were expressed in sink limited tissues while the senescing control leaves expressed WRKY and NAC transcription factors.  We identified genes that were not expressed during normal leaf development but highly expressed in sink-limited plants, including the D4 “non-yellowing” gene.  These changes highlighted several metabolic pathways that were involved in distinct modes of resource parttioning in the “stay green” leaves. Overall design: Timecourse gene expression analysis of sink-limited soybean leaves. Gene expression was profiled from R2 growth stage (flowering) until the onset of leaf seenscence, and contrasted between mechanically and genetically sink-limited soybeans."

190,"Sudden death syndrome (SDS) caused by the fungal pathogen, Fusarium virguliforme, is a major threat to soybean production in North America. There are two major components of this disease: (i) root necrosis and (ii) foliar SDS. Root symptoms consist of root necrosis with vascular discoloration that extends upto several nodes and internodes into the stem. Foliar SDS symptom is characterized by interveinal chlorosis and necrosis in leaves which finally curl and fall off, and in severe cases by flower, pod abscission and immature seed formation. A major toxin involved in initiating foliar SDS has been identified. Nothing is known about how root necrosis develops. In order to unravel the mechanisms used by the pathogen to cause root necrosis, the transcriptome of the pathogen in infected soybean root tissues of a susceptible cultivar (Williams 82) was investigated. The transcriptomes of the germinating conidia and mycelia were also examined. Of the 14,845 predicted F. virguliforme genes, we observed that 12,017 (81%) were expressed in germinating conidial spores and 12,208 (82%) in mycelia and 10,626 (72%) in infected soybean roots. Of the 10,626 genes induced in infected roots, 224 were transcribed only following infection. Expression of several infection-induced genes encoding enzymes with oxidation-reduction properties suggests that degradation of antimicrobial compounds such as the phytoalexin, glyceollin could be important in establishing the biotrophic phase. Enzymes with hydrolytic and catalytic activities could play an important role in the transitioning of the pathogen from biotrophic to necrotrophic phase. Expression of a large number of genes encoding enzymes with catalytic and hydrolytic activities during late infection stage suggests cell wall degradation by some of these enzymes could be involved in root necrosis and establishing the necrotrophic phase in this pathogen. Overall design: RNA-seq data for Fusarium virguliforme Mont-1 germinating conidial spores, mycelia and soybean root tissue 3 and 5 days or 10 and 24 days post water incubation or infection with Fusarium virguliforme Mont-1 conidial spores. Raw data for Fusarium virguliforme Mont-1 germinating conidial spores and mycelia are not available due to server failure."

192,Reads were obtained from an RNAseq study examining infection of Rotylenchulus reniformis (reniform nematode) on susceptible soybean. The goal of the study was to identify plant genes involved in the formation of the nematode-induced feeding site to better understand the mechanisms by which reniform nematodes parasitize plant roots.
193,"Breeding for pathogen resistance is an important objective to improve and protect soybean yields. Brown stem rot (BSR), caused by the fungus Phialophora gregata, reduces yield by as much as 38%. To date, three dominant BSR resistance genes have been identified: Rbs1, Rbs2, and Rbs3, however the gene networks regulating defense responses to BSR remain unknown. Further, identifying resistant germplasm by genotyping or phenotyping remains difficult due to complexities of soybean/P. gregata interactions. To better understand resistance mechanisms, we conducted RNA-Seq of P. gregata infected and mock infected leaf, stem, and root tissues of both a resistant (PI 437970, Rbs3) and a susceptible (Corsoy 79) soybean genotype. Samples were collected one-week post infection. Our bioinformatic analyses focused on treatment, genotype, and treatment by genotype effects on gene expression"
194,"One fascinating aspect of plant pathogen co-evolution is that pathogens use effectors to alter a broad range of host responses. RNA splicing functions in many physiological processes including plant immunity. However, how plant pathogens manipulate host RNA splicing process remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that PsAvr3c, an avirulence effector from oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae, physically binds to and stabilizes soybean (Glycine max) serine/arginine/lysine rich proteins GmSRKPs in vivo. SRKP, novel proteins associating with spliceosome components, are plant susceptibility factors against Phytophthora. Furthermore, RNA-seq data uncovers that differential splicing over one thousand soybean mRNA transcripts, including defense related genes, are significantly changed in GmSRKP1 over-expressing lines. Representative splicing events are verified in either infection assay or soybean transient expression assay. Our results demonstrate that plant pathogen utilize effector to reprogram host RNA splicing, uncovering a new strategy evolved by pathogens to defeat host immune system Overall design: Two independent soybean GFP-GmSRKP1 over-expression lines and one GFP control sample"
195,"The soybean (Glycine max) seed coat has distinctive, genetically programmed patterns of pigmentation and the recessive k1 mutation can epistatically overcome the dominant I and i-i alleles, which inhibit seed color by producing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting chalcone synthase (CHS) mRNAs. Small RNA sequencing of dissected regions of immature seed coats demonstrated that CHS siRNA levels cause the patterns produced by the i-i  and i-k alleles of the I locus, which restrict pigment to the hilum or saddle region of the seed coat, respectively. To identify the K1 locus, we compared RNA-Seq data from dissected regions of two Clark isolines having similar saddle phenotypes mediated by CHS siRNAs but different genotypes (homozygous i-k K1 versus homozygous i-i k1). By examining differentially expressed genes, mapping information, and genome resequencing, we identified a 129-bp deletion in Glyma.11G190900 encoding Argonaute5 (AGO5), a member of the Argonaute family. Amplicon sequencing of several independent saddle pattern mutants from different genetic backgrounds revealed independent lesions affecting AGO5, thus establishing Glyma.11G190900 as the K1 locus. Non-functional AGO5 from k1 alleles leads to altered distributions of CHS siRNAs, thus explaining how the k1 mutation reverses the phenotype of the seed coat regions from yellow to pigmented, even in the presence of the normally dominant I or i-i  alleles. Overall design: Immature seed coats of 100-200 mg with chimeric pigmented phenotypes of Clark 8 (i-k, K1) or Clark 18a (i-i, k1) were separated into the regions destined to become either the black saddle region or the yellow sections.  Extracted mRNAs were subjected to high throughput sequencing and analyzed for expression analyses to determine the genetic differences conferred by the K1 locus or the differences in expression in different dissected regions of the seed coat."
196,"Soybean(Glycine max), the third most cultivated crop, provides an important source of protein and oil to humans and animals worldwide. As a typical dicotyledon, soybean root architecture is taproot system. Soybean root growth and response to environmental cues are important factor for maintaining crop yields. As a common and efficient method, application of plant growth regulators can manipulate plant growth and yield. Uniconazole, a plant growth retardant, has been extensively applied in plants to increase tolerance and improve quality. In this study, we studied the effect of uniconazole treatment on root of Glycine max by genome-wide transcriptome. This research elucidated the complex mechanism of uniconazole treatment."

203,"The process of RNA splicing influences many physiological processes including plant immunity. However, how plant parasites manipulate host RNA splicing process remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that PsAvr3c, an avirulence effector from oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae, physically binds to and stabilizes soybean (Glycine max) serine/lysine/arginine rich proteins GmSKRPs in vivo. The SKRPs are novel proteins that associate with spliceosome components, and are negative regulators of plant immunity. Analysis by RNA-seq data indicates that alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs from 401 soybean genes, including defense related genes, is altered in GmSKRP1 and PsAvr3c over-expressing lines compared to control plants. Representative splicing events mediated by GmSKRP1 and PsAvr3c are tested by infection assays or by transient expression in soybean plants. Our results show that a plant pathogen effector can reprogram host pre-mRNA splicing to promote disease, and we propose that pathogens evolved such strategies to defeat host immune systems. Overall design: three independent soybean SKRP1 over-expression lines, three AVR3C over-expression samples and three GFP control samples"

205,"A dominant loss of function mutation in myo-inositol phosphate synthase gene and recessive loss of function mutations in two multidrug resistant protein type-ABC transporter genes not only reduce the seed phytic acid levels in soybean, but also affect the pathways associated with seed development, ultimately resulting in low emergence. To understand the regulatory mechanisms and identify key genes that intervene in the seed development process in low phytic acid crops, we performed computational inference of gene regulatory networks in low and normal phytic acid soybeans using a time course transcriptomic data and multiple network inference algorithms. We identified several transcription factors and their regulatory interactions with genes that have functions in myo-inositol biosynthesis, auxin-ABA signaling and seed dormancy. We validated the predicted regulatory network by comparing it with published regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis. Some regulatory interactions were found in the low phytic acid mutants but not in non-mutant plants. These findings provide important hypotheses on expression regulation of myo-inositol metabolism, and phytohormone signaling in developing low phytic acid soybeans. The computational pipeline used for unsupervised network learning in this study is provided as open source software and is freely available at https://lilabatvt.github.io/LPANetwork/. Overall design: Four soybean experimental lines designated as: (i) 3mlpa, (ii) 3MWT, (iii) 1mlpa, and (iv) 1MWT were used in this study. The lpa mutant line, '3mlpa', carrying three mutations mips1/mrp-l/mrp-n, and its non-mutant sibling line with normal phytic acid, '3MWT', were derived from crossing of 'CX-1834' (lpa line with two mpr-l/mrp-n mutations on soybean chromosomes 19 and 3, respectively) with 'V99-5089' (lpa line with single mips1 mutation) (Saghai Maroof et al., 2009). Another lpa line, '1mlpa', carrying a single mips1 mutation on soybean chromosome 11, and its isogenic sibling line with normal phytic acid, '1MWT', were derived from crossing of 'Essex' (a normal phytic acid line with no mutations) with V99-5089 (Saghai Maroof and Buss, 2008; Glover, 2011). Developing seeds were sampled in triplicates for each experimental soybean line based on seed lengths corresponding to 2-4 mm (stage1), 4-6 mm (stage2), 6-8 mm (stage3), 8-10 mm (stage4), and 10-12 mm (stage5), respectively. Samples were flash frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. High-quality total RNA (RIN 9-10) was extracted from frozen samples using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit, with on-column DNase digestion (QIAGEN).

299,"Silicon protects soybean plants against Phytophthora sojae by interfering with effector-receptor expression.By contrast, the transcriptomic response of Si-fed (Si+) plants was remarkably unaffected by the presence of P. sojae, and the expression of effector-coding genes by the pathogen was significantly reduced. Given that the apoplast is the key site of interaction between effectors and plant receptors in the soybean-P. sojae complex, as well as the site of amorphous-Si accumulation, our results indicate that Si likely interferes with the signaling network between P. sojae and the plant, preventing or decreasing the release of effectors reaching plant receptors, thus creating an incompatible interaction"

303,"The process of RNA splicing influences many physiological processes including plant immunity. However, how plant parasites manipulate host RNA splicing process remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that PsAvr3c, an avirulence effector from oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae, physically binds to and stabilizes soybean (Glycine max) serine/lysine/arginine rich proteins GmSKRPs in vivo. The SKRPs are novel proteins that associate with spliceosome components, and are negative regulators of plant immunity. Analysis by RNA-seq data indicates that alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs from 401 soybean genes, including defense related genes, is altered in GmSKRP1 and PsAvr3c over-expressing lines compared to control plants. Representative splicing events mediated by GmSKRP1 and PsAvr3c are tested by infection assays or by transient expression in soybean plants. Our results show that a plant pathogen effector can reprogram host pre-mRNA splicing to promote disease, and we propose that pathogens evolved such strategies to defeat host immune systems. Overall design: three independent soybean SKRP1 over-expression lines, three AVR3C over-expression samples and three GFP control samples"

305,"A dominant loss of function mutation in myo-inositol phosphate synthase gene and recessive loss of function mutations in two multidrug resistant protein type-ABC transporter genes not only reduce the seed phytic acid levels in soybean, but also affect the pathways associated with seed development, ultimately resulting in low emergence. To understand the regulatory mechanisms and identify key genes that intervene in the seed development process in low phytic acid crops, we performed computational inference of gene regulatory networks in low and normal phytic acid soybeans using a time course transcriptomic data and multiple network inference algorithms. We identified several transcription factors and their regulatory interactions with genes that have functions in myo-inositol biosynthesis, auxin-ABA signaling and seed dormancy. We validated the predicted regulatory network by comparing it with published regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis. Some regulatory interactions were found in the low phytic acid mutants but not in non-mutant plants. These findings provide important hypotheses on expression regulation of myo-inositol metabolism, and phytohormone signaling in developing low phytic acid soybeans. The computational pipeline used for unsupervised network learning in this study is provided as open source software and is freely available at https://lilabatvt.github.io/LPANetwork/. Overall design: Four soybean experimental lines designated as: (i) 3mlpa, (ii) 3MWT, (iii) 1mlpa, and (iv) 1MWT were used in this study. The lpa mutant line, '3mlpa', carrying three mutations mips1/mrp-l/mrp-n, and its non-mutant sibling line with normal phytic acid, '3MWT', were derived from crossing of 'CX-1834' (lpa line with two mpr-l/mrp-n mutations on soybean chromosomes 19 and 3, respectively) with 'V99-5089' (lpa line with single mips1 mutation) (Saghai Maroof et al., 2009). Another lpa line, '1mlpa', carrying a single mips1 mutation on soybean chromosome 11, and its isogenic sibling line with normal phytic acid, '1MWT', were derived from crossing of 'Essex' (a normal phytic acid line with no mutations) with V99-5089 (Saghai Maroof and Buss, 2008; Glover, 2011). Developing seeds were sampled in triplicates for each experimental soybean line based on seed lengths corresponding to 2-4 mm (stage1), 4-6 mm (stage2), 6-8 mm (stage3), 8-10 mm (stage4), and 10-12 mm (stage5), respectively. Samples were flash frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. High-quality total RNA (RIN 9-10) was extracted from frozen samples using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit, with on-column DNase digestion (QIAGEN). Total of 60 mRNA libraries were prepared from total RNA samples and sequenced as 100SE using HiSeq2000. This study includes the re-analysis of all samples in GSE75575"

420,"Regional Soybean landrace accessions with diverse genetic backgrounds are valuable resources for the efforts of soybean breeding programs, as only limited germplasm resources are currently available for breeding the best cultivars. To explore the molecular basis of drought tolerance traits of regional soybean collections, a localsoybean landrace LX together with the standard wild type William82 were chosen to perform the multi-omics analysis with the aim to understand the molecular basis of the desired traits of LX. Firstly, the germination potential of LX was investigated which confirmed the previous report that LX germinated better at drought stress conditions. Additionally, LX plants accumulated more anthocyanin at both normal and stress conditions, and exhibited better resistance to drought treatment comparing to William82. When grown at the same condition, the LX plants are greener than control lines and contain more chlorophyll. Collection of biochemical measurements all indicated that LX is more physiologically adaptive to stress conditions. Using untargeted mass spectrometry analysis in combination with transcriptomics analysis, we revealed the chemical diversity and genetic basis underlying the overall performance of LX landrace at the designed growth conditions. Under both normal and stress conditions, significant differences in the expressions of a suite of secondary metabolism genes, particularly the genes from general phenylpropanoid pathway, were detected in LX comparing to William82 plants. Consistently, correlating with the transcript analysis, a set of corresponding secondary metabolites with profoundly different accumulations were also detected in LX plants. Further correlation analysis between metabolites and transcripts pointed to a MYB transcription factor likely sitting at the top of the regulation module, which is responsible for the LX agronomic traits. Our study provides the multilateral information of global regulatory mechanism of secondary metabolism on soybean drought resistance."
421,"We examined the transcriptome induced by GmNAC81 overexpression and leaf senescence and showed that GmNAC81 further modulates leaf senescence by regulating an extensive repertoire of functionally characterized senescence-associated genes (SAGs). GmNAC81 overexpression also uncovered the regulation of typical drought-responsive genes. Key regulators and effectors of ABA signaling were suppressed by GmNAC81 overexpression.  Overall design: RNA was extracted from leaves collected in two developmental stages of the plant, vegetative stage three (V3; 20 days after germination, DAG) and reproductive stage six (R6; 80 DAG). Each developmental stage comprised a set of nine libraries."

426,"Here, the low-linolenic acid mutant “MT72” and the wild-type control “JN18” were used as materials. The lncRNAs in young pods at 30 and 40 days (d) after flowering were systematically identified and analyzed using transcriptome sequencing technology combined with bioinformatics tools. A total of 39,324 lncRNAs and 561 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified. A lncRNAs-miRNAs- protein-coding genes (mRNAs) network was constructed, and 46 lncRNAs, 46 miRNAs and 137 mRNAs were found to be correlated. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of 12 targeted mRNAs in the competing endogenous RNA network showed that these lncRNAs may be involved in the biological processes of fatty acid transport, lipid synthesis and cell division. Finally, the expression levels of differentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs were verified using qRT-PCR. The expression patterns of most genes were consistent with the sequencing results. In conclusion, new information was provided for the study of fatty acid synthesis by lncRNAs in young soybean pods. Overall design: Studies on low linolenic acid mutants “MT72” and wild-type “JN18” at 30d and 40d after flowering of soybean"

430,"Transcription is the first step of central dogma, in which the genetic information stored in DNA is copied into RNA. Other than mature RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), high throughput nascent RNA assays have been established and applied to provide details of transcription. We present here the first profiling of nascent RNA from trifoliate leaf and shoot apex of soybean. In combination of nascent RNA (chromatin bond RNA, CB RNA) and RNA-seq, we found that introns are largely spliced co-transcriptionally. Although alternative splicing (AS) is mainly determined at nascent RNA biogenesis, differential AS between tissues at mature RNA does not correlate well with co-transcriptional differential AS. Overall, RNA abundance is moderately correlated between nascent RNA and mature RNA in one tissue, but their fold changes between tissues is highly correlated at nascent RNA and mature RNA level. Thousands of novel transcripts (mainly noncoding RNA) were detected by CB RNA-seq, including two natural antisense RNA overlapped with two important genes controlling soybean reproductive development, FT2a and Dt1a. Taken together, we demonstrated the adoption of CB RNA-seq in soybean, which may shed light on gene expression regulation on important agronomic traits in leguminous crops."

439,"Iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) is an abiotic stress that negatively affects soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) production. Much of our knowledge of IDC stress responses is derived from model plant species. Gene expression, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed in soybean suggest that stress response differences exist between model and crop species. Our current understanding of the molecular response to IDC in soybeans is largely derived from gene expression studies using near-isogenic lines differing in iron efficiency. To improve iron efficiency in soybeans and other crops, we need to expand gene expression studies to include the diversity present in germplasm collections. Therefore, we collected 216 purified RNA samples (18 genotypes, two tissue types [leaves and roots], two iron treatments [sufficient and deficient], three replicates) and used RNA sequencing to examine the expression differences of 18 diverse soybean genotypes in response to iron deficiency. We found a rapid response to iron deficiency across genotypes, most responding within 60 min of stress. There was little evidence of an overlap of specific differentially expressed genes, and comparisons of gene ontology terms and transcription factor families suggest the utilization of different pathways in the stress response. These initial findings suggest an untapped genetic potential within the soybean germplasm collection that could be used for the continued improvement of iron efficiency in soybean."

446,"The low phytic acid trait in soybeans can be conferred by loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding myo-inositol phosphate synthase and two epistatically interacting genes encoding multidrug-resistance protein ABC transporters. However, perturbations in phytic acid biosynthesis are associated with poor seed vigor. Since the benefits of the low phytic acid trait, in terms of end-use quality and sustainability, far outweigh the negatives associated with poor seed performance, a fuller understanding of the molecular basis behind the negatives will assist crop breeders and engineers in producing variates with low phytic acid and better germination rate. The gene regulatory network for developing low and normal phytic acid soybean seeds was previously constructed, with genes modulating a variety of processes pertinent to phytic acid metabolism and seed viability being identified. In this study, a comparative time series analysis of low and normal phytic acid soybeans was carried out to investigate the transcriptional regulatory elements governing the transitional dynamics from dry seed to germinated seed. Gene regulatory networks were reverse engineered from time series transcriptomic data of three distinct genotypic subsets composed of low phytic acid soybean lines and their normal phytic acid sibling lines. Using a robust unsupervised network inference scheme, putative regulatory interactions were inferred for each subset of genotypes. These interactions were further validated by published regulatory interactions found in Arabidopsis thaliana and motif sequence analysis. Results indicate that low phytic acid seeds have increased sensitivity to stress, which could be due to changes in phytic acid levels, disrupted inositol phosphate signaling, disrupted phosphate ion homeostasis, and altered myo-inositol metabolism. Putative regulatory interactions were identified for the latter two processes. Changes in abscisic acid signaling candidate transcription factors putatively regulating genes in this process were identified as well. Analysis of the gene regulatory networks reveal altered regulation in processes that may be affecting the germination of low phytic acid soybean seeds. Therefore, this work contributes to the ongoing effort to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying altered seed viability, germination and field emergence of low phytic acid crops, understanding of which is necessary in order to mitigate these problems. Overall design: The four genotypic lines used in this study are designated as “MRP,” contains four near isogenic lines, the lpa line “2mlpa” (mrp-l and mrp-n mutations) and three normal phytic acid lines, “2MWT” (no mutation), “2MWT-L” (mrp-n mutation only), and “2MWT-N” (mrp-l mutation only). These lines were developed from a cross between the lpa lines “CX-1834” (mrp-1 and mrp-n mutations) and the normal phytic acid line V99-5089. The mutations conferring the lpa trait in 2mlpa and CX-1834 are the result of point mutations in the epistatically interacting loci, MRP-L and MRP-N, on chromosomes 19 and 3, respectively (Wilcox et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2006; Maroof et al., 2009). In the associated manuscript, eight experimental lines were used – 1mlpa, 1MWT, 2mlpa, 2MWT, 2MWT-L, 2MWT-N, 3mlpa, and 3MWT.  The eight experimental lines represent three distinct subsets of genotypes and data from four lines are included in this dataset. Other four lines have been released from our previous publication (data in GSE101692). Line mips1/mrp-l/mrp-n is also called 3mlpa which contains mips1, mrp-1, and mrp-n mutations and has low phytic acid content. The normal phytic acid line MIPS1/MRP-L/MRP-N (no mutation) is also called 3MWT. These lines were developed from a cross between CX-1834 and V99-5089. These files also include the lpa line 1mlpa (mips1 mutation) and the normal phytic acid line 1MWT (no mutation). These lines are isogenic and were developed from a cross between the normal phytic acid line Essex (no MIPS1 mutation) and the lpa line V99-5089 (mips1 mutation)."

Newly emerging or re-emerging viruses can also threaten soybean production, because current control measures may not be effective against them. Furthermore, detection and characterization of new plant viruses requires major efforts when no sequence or antibody-based resources are available. In this study, soybean fields were scouted for virus-like disease symptoms during 2016 growing season.

In addition, Fiskeby III incurs only mild yield loss during stress conditions, in comparison to other soybean lines. These characteristics have made it a valuable addition to the northern soybean breeding programs in the US and Canada. Conversely, Mandarin(Ottawa) is highly susceptible to disease and suffers severe phenotypic damage and yield loss when exposed to abiotic stresses such as iron deficiency, a major challenge to soybean production in the northern Midwestern United States. Using RNA-seq, we characterize the transcriptional response to iron deficiency in both Fiskeby III and Mandarin(Ottawa) to better understand abiotic stress tolerance. Previous work by our group identified a quantitative trait loci (QTL) region on chromosome 5 associated with Fiskeby III iron efficiency (Merry et al. 2019). This indicates that Fiskeby III may utilize iron deficiency stress mechanisms not previously characterized in soybean. Coupling virus induced gene silencing with RNA-seq, we identified a single high priority candidate gene that has a significant impact on iron deficiency response pathways. Characterization of the Fiskeby III responses to iron stress and the genes underlying the chromosome 5 QTL provides novel targets for improved abiotic stress tolerance in soybean."

However, the mechanism underlying the reduced levels of phytic acid (InsP6) in this LP line requires further elucidation. In this study, an intron retention (IR) event was detected in inositol-1,3,4 trisphosphate 5/6-kinase 3 (GmITPK3) in Natto, normal-phytate (NP) and LP leaves. The abundance of each IR transcripts (IRTs) was changed during seeds development may maintain the phytic acid level in Natto cultivar, however, the abundant of IRTs produced in LP line may perturb the phosphorylation of InsP4 to InsP5 and/or create a negative feedback effect on InsP4 and InsP3 synthesis, leading to reduced phytic acid levels in the LP line during seed development. Hence, the GmITPK3 mutant might involve the decrease the level of phytic acid in seeds without harming the plants, thus representing a new strategy for LP crop development."
