PRJNA395215,acid,56,seed: 56,Inference of transcription regulatory network in low phytic acid soybean seeds,"A dominant loss of function mutation in myo-inositol phosphate synthase gene and recessive loss of function mutations in two multidrug resistant protein type-ABC transporter genes not only reduce the seed phytic acid levels in soybean, but also affect the pathways associated with seed development, ultimately resulting in low emergence. To understand the regulatory mechanisms and identify key genes that intervene in the seed development process in low phytic acid crops, we performed computational inference of gene regulatory networks in low and normal phytic acid soybeans using a time course transcriptomic data and multiple network inference algorithms. We identified several transcription factors and their regulatory interactions with genes that have functions in myo-inositol biosynthesis, auxin-ABA signaling and seed dormancy. We validated the predicted regulatory network by comparing it with published regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis. Some regulatory interactions were found in the low phytic acid mutants but not in non-mutant plants. These findings provide important hypotheses on expression regulation of myo-inositol metabolism, and phytohormone signaling in developing low phytic acid soybeans. The computational pipeline used for unsupervised network learning in this study is provided as open source software and is freely available at https://lilabatvt.github.io/LPANetwork/. Overall design: Four soybean experimental lines designated as: (i) 3mlpa, (ii) 3MWT, (iii) 1mlpa, and (iv) 1MWT were used in this study. The lpa mutant line, '3mlpa', carrying three mutations mips1/mrp-l/mrp-n, and its non-mutant sibling line with normal phytic acid, '3MWT', were derived from crossing of 'CX-1834' (lpa line with two mpr-l/mrp-n mutations on soybean chromosomes 19 and 3, respectively) with 'V99-5089' (lpa line with single mips1 mutation) (Saghai Maroof et al., 2009). Another lpa line, '1mlpa', carrying a single mips1 mutation on soybean chromosome 11, and its isogenic sibling line with normal phytic acid, '1MWT', were derived from crossing of 'Essex' (a normal phytic acid line with no mutations) with V99-5089 (Saghai Maroof and Buss, 2008; Glover, 2011). Developing seeds were sampled in triplicates for each experimental soybean line based on seed lengths corresponding to 2-4 mm (stage1), 4-6 mm (stage2), 6-8 mm (stage3), 8-10 mm (stage4), and 10-12 mm (stage5), respectively. Samples were flash frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. High-quality total RNA (RIN 9-10) was extracted from frozen samples using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit, with on-column DNase digestion (QIAGEN). Total of 60 mRNA libraries were prepared from total RNA samples and sequenced as 100SE using HiSeq2000. This study includes the re-analysis of all samples in GSE75575",10.3389/fpls.2017.02029,29250090
PRJNA721706,acid,72,seed: 72,Network Inference of Transcriptional Regulation in Germinating Low Phytic Acid Soybean Seeds,"The low phytic acid trait in soybeans can be conferred by loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding myo-inositol phosphate synthase and two epistatically interacting genes encoding multidrug-resistance protein ABC transporters. However, perturbations in phytic acid biosynthesis are associated with poor seed vigor. Since the benefits of the low phytic acid trait, in terms of end-use quality and sustainability, far outweigh the negatives associated with poor seed performance, a fuller understanding of the molecular basis behind the negatives will assist crop breeders and engineers in producing variates with low phytic acid and better germination rate. The gene regulatory network for developing low and normal phytic acid soybean seeds was previously constructed, with genes modulating a variety of processes pertinent to phytic acid metabolism and seed viability being identified. In this study, a comparative time series analysis of low and normal phytic acid soybeans was carried out to investigate the transcriptional regulatory elements governing the transitional dynamics from dry seed to germinated seed. Gene regulatory networks were reverse engineered from time series transcriptomic data of three distinct genotypic subsets composed of low phytic acid soybean lines and their normal phytic acid sibling lines. Using a robust unsupervised network inference scheme, putative regulatory interactions were inferred for each subset of genotypes. These interactions were further validated by published regulatory interactions found in Arabidopsis thaliana and motif sequence analysis. Results indicate that low phytic acid seeds have increased sensitivity to stress, which could be due to changes in phytic acid levels, disrupted inositol phosphate signaling, disrupted phosphate ion homeostasis, and altered myo-inositol metabolism. Putative regulatory interactions were identified for the latter two processes. Changes in abscisic acid signaling candidate transcription factors putatively regulating genes in this process were identified as well. Analysis of the gene regulatory networks reveal altered regulation in processes that may be affecting the germination of low phytic acid soybean seeds. Therefore, this work contributes to the ongoing effort to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying altered seed viability, germination and field emergence of low phytic acid crops, understanding of which is necessary in order to mitigate these problems. Overall design: The four genotypic lines used in this study are designated as “MRP,” contains four near isogenic lines, the lpa line “2mlpa” (mrp-l and mrp-n mutations) and three normal phytic acid lines, “2MWT” (no mutation), “2MWT-L” (mrp-n mutation only), and “2MWT-N” (mrp-l mutation only). These lines were developed from a cross between the lpa lines “CX-1834” (mrp-1 and mrp-n mutations) and the normal phytic acid line V99-5089. The mutations conferring the lpa trait in 2mlpa and CX-1834 are the result of point mutations in the epistatically interacting loci, MRP-L and MRP-N, on chromosomes 19 and 3, respectively (Wilcox et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2006; Maroof et al., 2009). In the associated manuscript, eight experimental lines were used – 1mlpa, 1MWT, 2mlpa, 2MWT, 2MWT-L, 2MWT-N, 3mlpa, and 3MWT.  The eight experimental lines represent three distinct subsets of genotypes and data from four lines are included in this dataset. Other four lines have been released from our previous publication (data in GSE101692). Line mips1/mrp-l/mrp-n is also called 3mlpa which contains mips1, mrp-1, and mrp-n mutations and has low phytic acid content. The normal phytic acid line MIPS1/MRP-L/MRP-N (no mutation) is also called 3MWT. These lines were developed from a cross between CX-1834 and V99-5089. These files also include the lpa line 1mlpa (mips1 mutation) and the normal phytic acid line 1MWT (no mutation). These lines are isogenic and were developed from a cross between the normal phytic acid line Essex (no MIPS1 mutation) and the lpa line V99-5089 (mips1 mutation).",10.3389/fpls.2021.708286,34531883

Of 54,175 predicted soybean genes (Glyma v1.1), 35.52% exhibited expression oscillations in a 24 h period. This number increased to 39.23% when plants were submitted to water deficit. Major differences in gene expression were observed in the control plants from late day (ZT16) until predawn (ZT20) periods, indicating that gene expression oscillates during the course of 24 h in normal development. Under water deficit, dissimilarity increased in all time-periods, indicating that the applied stress influenced gene expression. Results suggest that time of day, as well as light and temperature oscillations that occur considerably affect the regulation of water deficit stress response in soybean plants.

In this study, we demonstrate that inserting a copy of soybean WRKY54 driven by a constitutive promoter of CMP (cestrum yellow leaf curling virus) or a drought induced promoter of RD29a, improves drought tolerance in transgenic soybean plants. GmWRKY54 is a transcriptional activator and regulates expressions of large numbers of stress-related genes. Using a GO enrichment toolkit, we found that GmWRKY54 up-regulated GO terms related to transcriptional regulator and gene expression and down-regulated GO terms related to photosynthesis and membrane. Using a co-expression network analysis, we find that dozens of genes are negatively co-expressing with photosynthetic genes. These genes are related to ABA signaling pathway, Ca2+ signaling pathway and transcriptional factors. Transgenic plants confer drought tolerance through improving stomatal closure, reducing transpiration rate and reducing membrane damage during water deficit. GmWRKY54 activates expression of these ABA or Ca2+ signaling-related genes, which finally regulates stomatal aperture. GmWRKY54 binds to the promoter regions of genes encoding an ABA receptor (PYL8-1), two calcium dependent protein kinase (CPK3-1 and CPK3-2), a CBL (Calcineurin B-like protein) interacting protein kinase (CIPK11-2), a SnRK family protein kinase and a ferritin, suggesting that they are the direct targets of GmWRKY54. Our study reveals that GmWRKY54 significantly improves drought tolerance in soybean and regulates expression of large numbers of drought-related genes, suggesting that GmWRKy54 maybe a master regulator of drought response. Overall design: Three transgenic soybean samples, A004A, A005B and B010C and the control plants (null) were chosen for RNA-seq.

To explore the molecular basis of drought tolerance traits of regional soybean collections, a localsoybean landrace LX together with the standard wild type William82 were chosen to perform the multi-omics analysis with the aim to understand the molecular basis of the desired traits of LX. Firstly, the germination potential of LX was investigated which confirmed the previous report that LX germinated better at drought stress conditions. Additionally, LX plants accumulated more anthocyanin at both normal and stress conditions, and exhibited better resistance to drought treatment comparing to William82. When grown at the same condition, the LX plants are greener than control lines and contain more chlorophyll. Collection of biochemical measurements all indicated that LX is more physiologically adaptive to stress conditions. Using untargeted mass spectrometry analysis in combination with transcriptomics analysis, we revealed the chemical diversity and genetic basis underlying the overall performance of LX landrace at the designed growth conditions. Under both normal and stress conditions, significant differences in the expressions of a suite of secondary metabolism genes, particularly the genes from general phenylpropanoid pathway, were detected in LX comparing to William82 plants. Consistently, correlating with the transcript analysis, a set of corresponding secondary metabolites with profoundly different accumulations were also detected in LX plants. Further correlation analysis between metabolites and transcripts pointed to a MYB transcription factor likely sitting at the top of the regulation module, which is responsible for the LX agronomic traits. Our study provides the multilateral information of global regulatory mechanism of secondary metabolism on soybean drought resistance.",,

In the present work, a RNA-seq-based analysis was used for the first time to investigate the molecular aspect of the interaction of a partially resistant soybean genotype with non-pathogenic/pathogenic isolates of F. oxysporum at 72 and 96 hours post inoculation (hpi). Markedly different gene expression profiles were observed in compatible and incompatible host-pathogen combinations. A peak of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was observed at 72 hpi in soybean roots in response to both isolates, although the number of DEGs was about eight times higher for the pathogenic isolate compared to the non-pathogenic one (1,659 vs. 203 DEGs, respectively). Furthermore, not only the number of genes, but also the magnitude of induction was much greater in response to the pathogenic isolate. This response included a stronger activation of many well-known defense-related genes, and several genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, transcription factors, secondary and sugar metabolism. In addition, 1130 fungal genes were differentially expressed between the F. oxysporum isolates in planta during the infection process. Interestingly, 10% of these genes encode plant cell-wall degrading enzymes, reactive oxygen species-related enzymes and fungal proteins involved in primary metabolic pathways. Such information may be useful in the development of new methods of broadening resistance of soybean to F. oxysporum, including the silencing of important fungal genes, and also to understand the molecular basis of soybean-F. oxysporum interactions. Overall design: Soybean seedlings mRNA profiles inoculated with a non-pathogenic and pathogenic isolates of F. oxysporum and collected at 72 and 96 hpi, were generated using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Control seedlings were also included for each time of inoculation. Three biological replicates were considered for each condition, 18 samples in total.",10.1186/s12864-015-2318-2,26689712

To date, three dominant BSR resistance genes have been identified: Rbs1, Rbs2, and Rbs3, however the gene networks regulating defense responses to BSR remain unknown. Further, identifying resistant germplasm by genotyping or phenotyping remains difficult due to complexities of soybean/P. gregata interactions. To better understand resistance mechanisms, we conducted RNA-Seq of P. gregata infected and mock infected leaf, stem, and root tissues of both a resistant (PI 437970, Rbs3) and a susceptible (Corsoy 79) soybean genotype.

PRJNA340881,fungus,4,root: 4,Investigation of the Fusarium virguliforme transcriptomes induced during infection of soybean roots suggests that enzymes with hydrolytic activities could play a major role in root necrosis,"Sudden death syndrome (SDS) caused by the fungal pathogen, Fusarium virguliforme, is a major threat to soybean production in North America. There are two major components of this disease: (i) root necrosis and (ii) foliar SDS. Root symptoms consist of root necrosis with vascular discoloration that extends upto several nodes and internodes into the stem. Foliar SDS symptom is characterized by interveinal chlorosis and necrosis in leaves which finally curl and fall off, and in severe cases by flower, pod abscission and immature seed formation. A major toxin involved in initiating foliar SDS has been identified. Nothing is known about how root necrosis develops. In order to unravel the mechanisms used by the pathogen to cause root necrosis, the transcriptome of the pathogen in infected soybean root tissues of a susceptible cultivar (Williams 82) was investigated. The transcriptomes of the germinating conidia and mycelia were also examined. Of the 14,845 predicted F. virguliforme genes, we observed that 12,017 (81%) were expressed in germinating conidial spores and 12,208 (82%) in mycelia and 10,626 (72%) in infected soybean roots. Of the 10,626 genes induced in infected roots, 224 were transcribed only following infection. Expression of several infection-induced genes encoding enzymes with oxidation-reduction properties suggests that degradation of antimicrobial compounds such as the phytoalexin, glyceollin could be important in establishing the biotrophic phase. Enzymes with hydrolytic and catalytic activities could play an important role in the transitioning of the pathogen from biotrophic to necrotrophic phase. Expression of a large number of genes encoding enzymes with catalytic and hydrolytic activities during late infection stage suggests cell wall degradation by some of these enzymes could be involved in root necrosis and establishing the necrotrophic phase in this pathogen. Overall design: RNA-seq data for Fusarium virguliforme Mont-1 germinating conidial spores, mycelia and soybean root tissue 3 and 5 days or 10 and 24 days post water incubation or infection with Fusarium virguliforme Mont-1 conidial spores. Raw data for Fusarium virguliforme Mont-1 germinating conidial spores and mycelia are not available due to server failure.","10.1371/journal.pone.0169963, 10.1371/journal.pone.0163106","28095498, 27760122"

The Rag2  gene of soybean provides resistance to soybean aphid biotypes I and II. Transcriptomic  analyses were performed on near isogenic lines (NILs) with the Rag2 allele for aphid resistance or rag2 for susceptibility at the Rag2 locus. Soybeans were infested with soybean aphids and leaves were collected at 0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours after infestation.  RNA were extracted and a high throughput RNA-seq approach was used to examine mRNA expression in Rag2 and rag2 soybean leaves. The expression of ~43,000 genes was detected in both the Rag2 and rag2 leaves. Statistical analysis identified 2361 genes significantly regulated between the resistant and susceptible lines at different times after aphid infestation. Genes found up-regulated in the Rag2 line were annotated as involved in the cell wall, secondary and hormone metabolism, as well as in stress, signaling and transcriptional responses. Genes found up-regulated in the rag2 line were annotated as involved in photosynthesis and carbon metabolism. Interestingly, mRNAs of 2 genes (unknown and mitochondrial protease) located within the Rag2 locus were expressed significantly higher in the  resistant genotype. The expression of the putative NBS-LRR resistant gene present in the Rag2 locus was not different between the two soybean lines. However, another NBL-LRR gene located just at the border of the Rag2 locus was and, therefore, may be involved in the differential resistance to aphid infestation exhibited by the two NIL genotypes analyzed.

Deploying soybean cultivars carrying race-specific resistance conferred by Rps genes is the most practicalapproach to managing this disease. Previously, two Rps genes, RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 conferring broad spectra of resistance to P. sojae isolates, were identified in a landrace PI 567139B and mapped to a 6.5-cM region on chromosome 3 and a 3.0-cM region on chromosome 16, corresponding to 840 kb and 600 kb of sequences, respectively,of the soybean reference genome. By analyzing ten and nine recombinants defined by genotypic and phenotypic screening of the 826 F2:3 families derived from two reciprocal crosses between the two parental lines of the mapping populations, RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 were further narrowed to a 151-kb region that harbors five genes including three NBS-LRR genes, and a 36-kb region that contains four genes including five NBS-LRR genes, respectively, according to the reference genome. Analysis of expressional changes of these nine genes before and after inoculation with the pathogen suggest that the counterparts of Glyma.03g034600 in the RpsUN1 region and the counterparts of Glyma.16g215200 and Glyma.16g214900 in the RpsUN2 region of PI 567139B may be associated with the resistance to P. sojae. It is also suggested that unequal recombination between different NBS-LRR genes in the mapped regions may have occurred, resulting in the formation of two recombinants with inconsistent genotypes and phenotypes detected by molecular markers within the fine-mapped regions. The haplotypes of genomic regions surrounding RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 in the entire soybean germplasm deposited in the US soybean germplasm collection were analyzed towards a better understanding of the origins of these two novel sources of resistance and screening of effective markers for marker-assisted selectionof these two resistance genes for soybean breeding.

Rps genes are race-specific, yet the mechanism of resistance, as well as susceptibility, remains largely unclear. Taking advantage of RNA-seq technology, we sequenced the transcriptomes of 10 near isogenic lines (NIL), each with a unique Rps gene, and the recurrent susceptible parent 'Williams'. A total of 4330 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in 'Williams' while 2075 to 5499 DEGs were identified in each NIL. Comparisons between the NILs and 'Williams' allowed classification of two major groups of DEGs of interest: incompatible reaction associated genes (IRAGs) and compatible reaction associated genes (CRAGs). Hierarchical cluster analysis divided NILs into three clusters: Cluster I (Rps1-a), Cluster II (Rps1-b, 1-c and 1-k) and Cluster III (Rps3-a, 3-b, 3-c, 4, 5, and 6). Heatmap analysis, along with GO analysis suggested that the diversity of clusters for NILs were likely due to variation of the number of DEGs and the intensity of gene expression, rather than functional differentiation. Further analysis suggested that transcription factors might play pivotal role in determination of the cluster pattern, and that WRKY family were strongly associated with incompatible reactions. Analysis of IRAGs and CRAGs with putative functions suggested that the regulation of many phytohormone signaling pathways were associated with incompatible or compatible interactions with potential crosstalk between each other. As such, our study provides an in depth view of both incompatible and compatible interactions between soybean and P. sojae, which provides further insight into the mechanisms involved in host-pathogen interactions.

Much of our knowledge of IDC stress responses is derived from model plant species. Gene expression, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed in soybean suggest that stress response differences exist between model and crop species. Our current understanding of the molecular response to IDC in soybeans is largely derived from gene expression studies using near-isogenic lines differing in iron efficiency. To improve iron efficiency in soybeans and other crops, we need to expand gene expression studies to include the diversity present in germplasm collections. Therefore, we collected 216 purified RNA samples (18 genotypes, two tissue types [leaves and roots], two iron treatments [sufficient and deficient], three replicates) and used RNA sequencing to examine the expression differences of 18 diverse soybean genotypes in response to iron deficiency. We found a rapid response to iron deficiency across genotypes, most responding within 60 min of stress. There was little evidence of an overlap of specific differentially expressed genes, and comparisons of gene ontology terms and transcription factor families suggest the utilization of different pathways in the stress response.

Conversely, Mandarin(Ottawa) is highly susceptible to disease and suffers severe phenotypic damage and yield loss when exposed to abiotic stresses such as iron deficiency, a major challenge to soybean production in the northern Midwestern United States. Using RNA-seq, we characterize the transcriptional response to iron deficiency in both Fiskeby III and Mandarin(Ottawa) to better understand abiotic stress tolerance. Previous work by our group identified a quantitative trait loci (QTL) region on chromosome 5 associated with Fiskeby III iron efficiency (Merry et al. 2019). This indicates that Fiskeby III may utilize iron deficiency stress mechanisms not previously characterized in soybean. Coupling virus induced gene silencing with RNA-seq, we identified a single high priority candidate gene that has a significant impact on iron deficiency response pathways.

Methods: mRNA sequencing reads (101SE) were generated in triplicate from five seed developmental stages of 3mlpa and 3MWT soybean line using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Results: A total of 4235 differentially expressed genes, including 512-transcription factor genes were identified. Eighteen biological processes such as apoptosis, glucan metabolism, cellular transport, photosynthesis and 9 transcription factor families including WRKY, CAMTA3 and SNF2 were enriched during seed development. Genes associated with apoptosis, glucan metabolism, and cellular transport showed enhanced expression in early stages of lpa seed development, while those associated with photosynthesis showed decreased expression in late developmental stages. Conclusion: This study provides a global perspective of transcriptomal changes during soybean seed development in 3mlpa mutant. The results suggest that low phtic acid-causing mutations in 3mlpa play a role in inducing and suppressing plant defense responses during early and late stages of seed development, respectively.

Analysis of RNA-Seq data from different developmental stages revealed the differential expression of many genes including transcription factors. In this study, we focused on NAC and YABBY transcription factors which showed a conspicuous expression pattern during soybean seedling development. Their expression gradually increases from stage 1 to stage 4 of soybean germinating cotyledons. The highest level of expression was found at stage 4. Then it gradually decreased as the germinating cotyledons develop a mature seedling. We investigated the differential expression of NAC and YABBY regulated genes between stage 3 (before the functional transition) and stage 6 (after the functional transition) using our RNA-Seq data.

RNA was sequenced from seven different stages of seed development, yielding between 12 million and 78 million sequenced transcripts. These have been aligned to the 79,000 gene models predicted from the soybean genome recently sequenced by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. Over one hundred gene models were identified with high expression exclusively in young seed stages, starting at just four days after fertilization. These were annotated as being related to many basic components and processes such as histones and proline-rich proteins. Genes involved with some storage proteins such as glycinin and beta-conglycinin had their highest expression levels at the stages of largest fresh weight, confirming previous knowledge that these storage products are being rapidly accumulated before the seed begins the desiccation process. Other gene models showed high expression in the dry, mature seeds, perhaps indicating the preparation of pathways needed later, in the early stages of imbibition. Many highly-expressed gene models at the dry seed stage are, as expected, annotated as hydrophilic proteins associated with low water conditions, such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and dehydrins, which help preserve the cellular structures and nutrients within the seed during desiccation. Hundreds of transcription factors with notable expression in at least one stage of seed development were also identified and examined. Results from a second biological replicate demonstrate high reproducibility of these data.

We assessed detailed temporal transcriptional and metabolic changes in developing soybean embryos to gain a systems biology view of developmental and metabolic changes and to identify potential targets for metabolic engineering. Two major developmental and metabolic transitions were captured enabling identification of potential metabolic engineering targets specific to seed filling and to desiccation. The first transition involved a switch between different types of metabolism in dividing and elongating cells. The second transition involved the onset of maturation and desiccation tolerance during seed filling and a switch from photoheterotrophic to heterotrophic metabolism. Clustering analyses of metabolite and transcript data revealed clusters of functionally related metabolites and transcripts active in these different developmental and metabolic programs. The gene clusters provide a resource to generate predictions about the associations and interactions of unknown regulators with their targets based on    guilt-by-association    relationships.

In sink-limited tissues, we observed a deferral of the expression of senescence-associated genes and a continued high expression of genes associated with the maturity phase of leaf development. We identified GO-terms associated with growth and development and storage protein in sink limited tissues. We also identified that the bHLH. ARFs, and SBP transcription factors were expressed in sink limited tissues while the senescing control leaves expressed WRKY and NAC transcription factors.  We identified genes that were not expressed during normal leaf development but highly expressed in sink-limited plants, including the D4 “non-yellowing” gene.  These changes highlighted several metabolic pathways that were involved in distinct modes of resource parttioning in the “stay green” leaves.

RM55-rm is homozygous for a mutable allele (rm) that specifies black and brown striped seeds; RM30-R* is a stable black revertant isoline derived from the mutable line; and RM38-r has brown seed coats due to a recessive r allele shown to translate a truncated MYB protein. Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated  RM55-rm line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated TgmR*) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the R locus, Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by R was expressed at only very low levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-R* line, it upregulated expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (ANS2, ANS3) to promote the synthesis of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-R* revertant also carried the 13 kb TgmR* insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13kb TgmR* element. As determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the TgmR* sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-R* than in the mutable RM55-rm progenitor line. The stabilized and more methylated RM30-R* revertant line apparently lacks effective binding of a transposae to its subterminal repeats, thus allowing intron splicing to proceed resulting in sufficient MYB protein to stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats. In this regard, the TgmR* element in soybean resembles McClintock’s Spm-suppressible and change-of-state alleles of maize. This comparison explains the opposite effects of the TgmR* element on intron splicing of the MYB gene in which it resides depending on the methylation state of the element. Overall design: Differential RNA expression of anthocyanin pathway genes in the seed coats of two seed color lines: RM30-R* (black) and RM38-r (brown).

Soybean (Glycine max) is especially ozone sensitive, and research into its response to oxidative stress is limited.  To better understand the genetic response in soybean to oxidative stress, an RNA-seq analysis of two soybean cultivars was performed comparing an ozone intolerant cultivar and an ozone resistant cultivar after being exposed to ozone.  A cursory analysis of the transcriptome data revealed differences between cultivars in the expression levels of genes previously implicated in oxidative stress responses, indicating unique cultivar-specific responses.  An examination of the timing of gene responses over the course of ozone exposure showed expression of cuticle wax genes in the intolerant line over all sampled time points, whereas the tolerant line only expressed this pathway in the first time point.  The ozone tolerant cultivar has a thicker leaf structure and we believe this lends a passive benefit to the plant which the intolerant cultivar is attempting to supplement via cuticle wax synthesis.  These results suggest that differences in genetic responses work in concert with physiological differences to explain differences in ozone tolerance between soybean cultivars.

Methods: RNASeq data were collected from 6 biological samples of soybeans gR1.fastqing with or without weeds. Weed species and the methods to maintain weed free controls varied between years to mitigate treatment effects and to allow detection of general soybeans weed responses.  Key results: Soybean plants were not visibly nutrient or water stressed. We identified 55 consistently down-regulated genes in weedy plots. Many of the down-regulated genes were heat shock genes. Fourteen genes were consistently up-regulated. Several transcription factors including a PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-like gene (PIF3) were included among the up-regulated genes. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated roles for increased oxidative stress and jasmonic acid signaling responses during weed stress. Main conclusion: The relationship of this weed-induced PIF3 gene to genes involved in shade avoidance responses in arabidopsis provide evidence that this gene may be important in the response of soybean to weeds. These results suggest the weed-induced PIF3 gene will be a target for manipulating weed tolerance in soybean. Overall design: Samples were collected from two treatments (Control and Weedy) with six biological replicates (2008, 2009, and twop each for 2010 and 2011) for each treatment.",10.1111/nph.13351,25711503

However, how plant parasites manipulate host RNA splicing process remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that PsAvr3c, an avirulence effector from oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae, physically binds to and stabilizes soybean (Glycine max) serine/lysine/arginine rich proteins GmSKRPs in vivo. The SKRPs are novel proteins that associate with spliceosome components, and are negative regulators of plant immunity. Analysis by RNA-seq data indicates that alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs from 401 soybean genes, including defense related genes, is altered in GmSKRP1 and PsAvr3c over-expressing lines compared to control plants. Representative splicing events mediated by GmSKRP1 and PsAvr3c are tested by infection assays or by transient expression in soybean plants. Our results show that a plant pathogen effector can reprogram host pre-mRNA splicing to promote disease, and we propose that pathogens evolved such strategies to defeat host immune systems. Overall design: three independent soybean SKRP1 over-expression lines, three AVR3C over-expression samples and three GFP control samples",10.1038/s41467-017-02233-5,29233978

PRJNA246058,salt,21,root: 21,Comprehensive characterization and RNA-Seq profiling of the HD-Zip transcription factor family in soybean (Glycine max) during dehydration and salt stress,"Background The homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) transcription factor family is one of the largest plant specific superfamilies, and includes genes with roles in modulation of plant growth and response to environmental stresses. Many HD-Zip genes are characterized in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and members of the family are being investigated for abiotic stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and cucumber (Cucmis sativus). Findings in these species suggest HD-Zip genes as high priority candidates for crop improvement. Results In this study we have identified members of the HD-Zip gene family in soybean cv. ''Williams 82'', and characterized their expression under dehydration and salt stress. Homology searches with BLASTP and Hidden Markov Model guided sequence alignments identified 101 HD-Zip genes in the soybean genome. Phylogeny reconstruction coupled with domain and gene structure analyses using soybean, Arabidopsis, rice, grape (Vitis vinifera), and Medicago truncatula homologues enabled placement of these sequences into four previously described subfamilies. Of the 101 HD-Zip genes identified in soybean, 88 exist as whole-genome duplication-derived gene pairs, indicating high retention of these genes following polyploidy in Glycine ~10 Mya. The HD-Zip genes exhibit ubiquitous expression patterns across 24 conditions that include 17 tissues of soybean. An RNA-Seq experiment performed to study differential gene expression at 0, 1, 6 and 12 hr soybean roots under dehydration and salt stress identified 20 differentially expressed (DE) genes. Several of these DE genes are orthologs of genes previously reported to play a role under abiotic stress, implying conservation of HD-Zip gene functions across species. Screening of HD-Zip promoters identified transcription factor binding sites that are overrepresented in the DE genes under both dehydration and salt stress, providing further support for the role of HD-Zip genes in abiotic stress responses. Conclusions We provide a thorough description of soybean HD-Zip genes, and identify potential candidates with probable roles in dehydration and salt stress. Expression profiles generated for all soybean genes, under dehydration and salt stress, at four time points, will serve as an important resource for the soybean research community, and will aid in understanding plant responses to abiotic stress. Overall design: We sequenced mRNA from soybean cv. Williams 82 root samples that includes three control samples (0 hr), and three biological replicates for each of the three time points 1, 6 and 12 hr under dehydration and salt stress",10.1186/1471-2164-15-950,25362847

Its possible function in plants is less clear. In the present study, we tested the effect of melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) on soybean growth and development. Both spraying of leaves and seed-coating with melatonin significantly promoted soybean growth as judged from leaf size and plant height. This enhancement was also observed in soybean production and their fatty acid content. Melatonin increased pod number, seed number and seed weight. However, the 100-seed weight was not influenced by melatonin application. Melatonin also improved soybean tolerance to salt and drought stresses. Transcriptome analysis revealed that melatonin up-regulated the expression of many genes and alleviated the inhibitory effects of salt stress on gene expressions. Further detailed analysis of the affected pathways documents that melatonin likely achieved its promotional roles in soybean through enhancement of genes involved in cell division, photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and ascorbate metabolism. Our results demonstrate that melatonin has significant potential for improving of soybean growth and seed production. Further study should uncover more about the molecular mechanisms of melatonin’s function in soybeans and other crops. Overall design: Four different treatments were chosen, water, salt, 100µM melatonin and salt plus 100µM melatonin.

Clark standard, CS) and a mutant (cv. Clark glabrous, i.e., trichomeless or hairless, CG) soybean isoline that carries the dominant P1 allele. DGE data and RNA-Seq data were mapped to the cDNAs (Glyma models) predicted from the reference soybean genome, Williams 82. Extending the model length by 250 bp at both ends resulted in significantly more matches of authentic DGE tags indicating that many of the predicted gene models are prematurely truncated at the 5' and 3' UTRs. The genome-wide comparative study of the transcript profiles of the wild-type versus mutant line revealed a number of differentially expressed genes. One highly-expressed gene, Glyma04g35130, in wild-type soybean was of interest as it has high homology to the cotton gene GhRDL1 gene that has been identified as being involved in cotton fiber initiation and is a member of the BURP protein family. Sequence comparison of Glyma04g35130 among Williams 82 with our sequences derived from CS and CG isolines revealed various SNPs and indels including addition of one nucleotide C in the CG and insertion of ~60 bp in the third exon of CS that causes a frameshift mutation and premature truncation of peptides in both lines as compared to Williams 82.

The three mutants include a gnarled trichome mutant (known as R55C01 or FN0175501), a high seed protein mutant (known as R15C01 or FN0171501) and a short petiole architecture mutant (known as 'Christmas tree', 6R44C72 or FN0164472).  Genetic mapping  of the gnarled trichome mutant using whole genome sequence-based bulked segregant analysis identified a 26.6 megabase interval on chromosome 20 that co-segregates with the phenotype. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of the mutant indicated that the chromosome 20 interval included a small structural variant within the coding region of a soybean ortholog (Glyma.20G019300) of Arabidopsis Nck-Associated Protein 1 (NAP1), an important regulator of actin nucleation during trichome morphogenesis. Sequence analysis of the candidate allele revealed multiple rearrangements within the coding region, including two deletions (approximately 1-2 kb each), a translocation, and an inversion. Further analyses revealed that the mutated allele perfectly co-segregated with the phenotype, and a wild-type soybean NAP1 transgene functionally complemented the Arabidopsis nap1 mutant (grl-4). Additionally, mapping and exon sequencing of NAP1 in a spontaneous soybean gnarled trichome mutant (T31) identified a frame shift mutation resulting in a truncation of the coding region. These data indicate that the soybean NAP1 gene is essential for proper trichome development and that the soybean gnarled phenotype resulted from complex structural rearrangements induced by fast neutron mutagenesis at the NAP1 locus",,

PRJNA350330,type,12,seed coat: 12,Mutations in Argonaute5 Illuminate Epistatic Interactions of the K1 and I Loci Leading to Saddle Seed Color Patterns in Glycine max,"The soybean (Glycine max) seed coat has distinctive, genetically programmed patterns of pigmentation and the recessive k1 mutation can epistatically overcome the dominant I and i-i alleles, which inhibit seed color by producing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting chalcone synthase (CHS) mRNAs. Small RNA sequencing of dissected regions of immature seed coats demonstrated that CHS siRNA levels cause the patterns produced by the i-i  and i-k alleles of the I locus, which restrict pigment to the hilum or saddle region of the seed coat, respectively. To identify the K1 locus, we compared RNA-Seq data from dissected regions of two Clark isolines having similar saddle phenotypes mediated by CHS siRNAs but different genotypes (homozygous i-k K1 versus homozygous i-i k1). By examining differentially expressed genes, mapping information, and genome resequencing, we identified a 129-bp deletion in Glyma.11G190900 encoding Argonaute5 (AGO5), a member of the Argonaute family. Amplicon sequencing of several independent saddle pattern mutants from different genetic backgrounds revealed independent lesions affecting AGO5, thus establishing Glyma.11G190900 as the K1 locus. Non-functional AGO5 from k1 alleles leads to altered distributions of CHS siRNAs, thus explaining how the k1 mutation reverses the phenotype of the seed coat regions from yellow to pigmented, even in the presence of the normally dominant I or i-i  alleles. Overall design: Immature seed coats of 100-200 mg with chimeric pigmented phenotypes of Clark 8 (i-k, K1) or Clark 18a (i-i, k1) were separated into the regions destined to become either the black saddle region or the yellow sections.

In this study, soybean fields were scouted for virus-like disease symptoms during 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. Total RNA was extracted from symptomatic soybean tissues collected individually. cDNA libraries were prepared and RNA sequencing was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) Illumina HiSeq3000 (Illumina, https://www.illumina.com/) to generate paired-end reads (HiSeq: 2 * 150 bp, 2 lanes).

PRJNA140453,,4,cotyledon: 3 | seed: 1,Epigenetic Regulation of the Transition from Seed Maturation to Germination in Soybean,"How epigenetics is involved in the transition from seed maturation to seed germination largely remains elusive. To uncover the possible role of epigenetics in gene expression during the transition from seed maturation to seed germination in soybean, the transcriptome of cotyledons from four stages of soybean seed maturation and germination, including mid-late maturation, late maturation, seed dormancy and seed germination, were profiled by Illumina sequencing. For the genes that are quantitatively regulated at the four stages, two antagonistic epigenetic marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, together with the binding of RNA polymerase II, were investigated at the four stages by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). For 10 out of 16 genes examined, the relative enrichment of histone modification marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) and RNA polymerase II binding on their promoter regions correlates well with their relative expression levels at four stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetics in transcriptional regulation. A striking finding is that seed germination-specific genes start to show open chromatin (H3K4me3) during late seed maturation although their transcripts do not accumulate, which is further supported by RNA polymerase II binding. Together, our results provide the first evidence that seed germination genes can be primed for transcription (open chromatin and RNA polymerase II binding) during seed maturation, highlighting that the transition from seed maturation to seed germination starts at late seed maturation stages at both the genetic and epigenetic levels.

In addition, genes with potential additive and non-additive effects were identified in two mapping lines, several of these with a potential function in the control of the innate immunity. Likewise, we observed that some genes differentially expressed across the parental and mapping lines showed different DNA methylation patterns. Finally, a gene regulatory module analysis identified key networks that likely control soybean innate immunity.

The net pattern mutation creates breaks in the seed coat of soybean (Glycine max) because of ruptured cell walls. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the seed coat transcriptome from three stages of immature seed development in two pairs of isolines with normal or defective seed coat phenotypes due to the net pattern. The genome-wide comparative study of the transcript profiles of these isolines revealed 364 differentially expressed genes in common between the two varieties that were further divided into different broad functional categories. Genes related to cell wall processes accounted for 19% of the differentially expressed genes in the middle developmental stage of 100-200 mg seed weight. Within this class, the cell wall proline-rich and glycine-rich protein genes were highly differentially expressed in both genetic backgrounds. Other genes that showed significant expression changes in each of the isoline pairs at the 100-200 mg seed weight stage were xylem serine proteinase, fasciclin-related genes, auxin and stress response related genes, TRANSPARENT TESTA 1 (TT1) and other transcription factors. The mutant appears to shift the timing of either the increase or decrease in the levels of some of the transcripts.  The analysis of these data sets reveals the physiological changes that the seed coat undergoes during the formation of the breaks in the cell wall.

Discovery and analysis of sequence and expression variations in these genes will accelerate soybean oil quality improvement. In an effort to identify these variations, we sequenced the transcriptomes of soybean seeds from nine lines varying in oil composition and/or total oil content. Our results showed that 69,338 distinct transcripts from 32,885 annotated genes were expressed in seeds. A total of 8,037 transcript expression polymorphisms and 50,485 transcript sequence polymorphisms (48,792 SNPs and 1,693 small Indels) were identified among the lines.  Effects of the transcript polymorphisms on their encoded protein sequences and functions were predicted. The studies also provided independent evidence that the lack of FAD2-1A gene activity and a non-synonymous SNP in the coding sequence of FAB2C caused elevated oleic acid and stearic acid levels in soybean lines M23 and FAM94-41, respectively. As a proof-of-concept, we developed an integrated RNA-seq and bioinformatics approach to identify and functionally annotate transcript polymorphisms, and demonstrated its high effectiveness for discovery of genetic and transcript variations that result in altered oil quality traits. The collection of transcript polymorphisms coupled with their predicted functional effects will be a valuable asset for further discovery of genes, gene variants, and functional markers to improve soybean oil quality.

They recognize and bind to epigenetically modified histone H3 'tail'. Here we reported that an Alfin1-like soybean protein, GmPHD6, read H3K4me0/1/2 but not H3K4me3 with the N-terminal instead of the PHD finger. GmPHD6 does not possess transcriptional regulatory ability. Through the PHD finger, GmPHD6 interacts with its co-activator, LHP1-1/2. Using a transgenic hairy root system, we demonstrated that over-expression of GmPHD6 improved stress tolerance in transgenic soybean composites. Perhaps due to the excessive amount of LHP1 compared to that of GmPHD6, over-expression of LHP1-1/2 failed to do so. The integrity of the complex is essential in stress response, for the abrogation of DNA binding activity of GmPHD6 or the decrease of LHP1 content leads to stress sensitivity in soybean. GmPHD6 influences expression of dozens of stress-related genes to confer stress tolerance. Among these genes, we identified three direct targets of GmPHD6, ASR (ABA-stress-ripening induced), CYP71A22 (cytochrome P450) and CYP82C4. Our study reveals significant findings in stress response. GmPHD6 and LHP1 are recruited to H3K4me0/1/2 marks, where several stress-related genes may locate in, to form a transcriptional activation complex. GmPHD6 locates target sites through recognizing the G-rich elements in their promoters; LHP1 enhances expression levels of these targets. Genetically engineering of GmPHD6/LHP1 complex should improve stress tolerance in crop plants.

Immunoblot analysis indicated that an adequate amount of protein was present for immunoprecipitation. To study rhizobial-induced transcriptional changes in the cortex during early nodule development, we identified a soybean promoter (Glyma.18g53890, Figure 1B) expressed exclusively in the cortex cells using LCM (Kerk et al., 2003; Casson et al., 2008) followed by transcriptional analysis. The cortex-specific promoter was used to drive the expression of GmRPL18 in soybean hairy roots. To capture events occurring in the cortex during the early stages of infection and initial cortical cell divisions, we inoculated plants and performed a time-course collection of root samples at 72- and 96-hour post inoculation (hpi) followed by TRAP-seq. Immunoblot analysis indicated that an adequate amount of protein was present for immunoprecipitation (Figure 1C). Taken together, time-course cortex-specific TRAP-seq was established for studying of early nodule development in soybean.

PRJNA802889,,6,leaf: 6,"A Low-Phytate Soybean Line Disturbs Seed Development-Dependent mRNA Splicing in the Phytate synthesis gene inositol-1,3,4 trisphosphate 5/6-kinase (GmITPK3)","Low-phytate (LP) crops may improve the mineral bioavailability in monogastric animals, which will serve to decrease phosphate pollution. Recently, we reported a newly developed LP soybean line with normal emergence, growth, and yield when compared to the Natto-kotsubu (Natto) cultivar as well as lower phytic acid content than the CX1834 line. However, the mechanism underlying the reduced levels of phytic acid (InsP6) in this LP line requires further elucidation. In this study, an intron retention (IR) event was detected in inositol-1,3,4 trisphosphate 5/6-kinase 3 (GmITPK3) in Natto, normal-phytate (NP) and LP leaves. The abundance of each IR transcripts (IRTs) was changed during seeds development may maintain the phytic acid level in Natto cultivar, however, the abundant of IRTs produced in LP line may perturb the phosphorylation of InsP4 to InsP5 and/or create a negative feedback effect on InsP4 and InsP3 synthesis, leading to reduced phytic acid levels in the LP line during seed development. Hence, the GmITPK3 mutant might involve the decrease the level of phytic acid in seeds without harming the plants, thus representing a new strategy for LP crop development.",,
