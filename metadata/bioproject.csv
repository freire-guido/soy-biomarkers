PRJDB10183,Glycine max,RNA sequencing of fungal-fermented soybean,"Flavonoids are an important class of plant specialized metabolites. They have various biological functions, including antioxidant action and interaction with other organisms. For example, daidzein and genistein are required for symbiosis with rhizobia, and daidzein is a precursor of glyceollin. Previous studies showed that isoflavonoids were increased by the inoculation of fungi in soybean. However, transcriptomic and metabolomic change by fungal inoculation has not yet been investigated. In this study, we investigated the metabolic response of fungal-fermented soybean seedlings at the transcriptome and metabolome levels.",32894761,"Isoflavonoids are commonly found in leguminous plants. Glycitein is one of the isoflavones produced by soybean. The genes encoding the enzymes in the isoflavone biosynthetic pathway have mostly been identified and characterized. However, the gene(s) for isoflavone O-methyltransferase (IOMT), which catalyzes the last step of glycitein biosynthesis, has not yet been identified. In this study, we conducted multi-omics analyses of fungal-inoculated soybean and indicated that glycitein biosynthesis was induced in response to biotic stress. Moreover, we identified a unique type of IOMT, which participates in glycitein biosynthesis. Soybean seedlings were inoculated with Aspergillus oryzae or Rhizopus oligosporus and sampled daily for 8&#x2009;d. Multi-omics analyses were conducted using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing. Metabolome analysis revealed that glycitein derivatives increased following fungal inoculation. Transcriptome co-expression analysis identified two candidate IOMTs that were co-expressed with the gene encoding flavonoid 6-hydroxylase (F6H), the key enzyme in glycitein biosynthesis. The enzymatic assay of the two IOMTs using respective recombinant proteins showed that one IOMT, named as GmIOMT1, produced glycitein. Unlike other IOMTs, GmIOMT1 belongs to the cation-dependent OMT family and exhibited the highest activity with Zn2+ among cations tested. Moreover, we demonstrated that GmIOMT1 overexpression increased the levels of glycitein derivatives in soybean hairy roots when F6H was co-expressed. These results strongly suggest that GmIOMT1 participates in inducing glycitein biosynthesis in response to biotic stress."
PRJNA881271,Inner Mongolia Academy of Agricultural &amp; Animal Husbandry Sciences,Transcriptome analysis of soybean roots in response to boron deficiency,"Boron (B) is an essential micronutrient essential for normal plant normal growth and development. B deficiency is detrimental to Glycine max (L.) Merr., which is one of the leading oil-crops. species, is extremely susceptible to B deficiency. In this study, the physiological analysis of soybean seedlings under B deficiency (T1, T2, T3, T4) and control (CK1, CK2, CK3, CK4) after 12 h, 24 h, 72 h, and 8 d was carried out, and the roots were subjected to transcriptome sequencing analysis. The results showed that under B deficiency, the plant height, SPAD, and chlorophyll fluorescence value (Fv/Fm) of soybean seedlings decreased significantly, indicating that B stresses significantly inhibited plant growth and photosynthesis. After RNA-seq sequencing, showed a total of 5126 DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) were obtained, including 953 DEGs at 12 h, 760 DEGs at 24 h, 1945 DEGs at 72 h and 1468 DEGs at 8 d. There were 9Nine DEGs co-existed at the four-time treatmentspoints, among which GLYMA_03G130600 regulated regulates transcription factor ORG3, which was is related to plant growth. GO analysis showed thatrevealed a total of annotated 8763 DEGs were annotated, among which the terms plasma membrane, extracellular, enzyme activity, ion transport metabolic process and oxidoreductase activity were significantly enriched at the four -time treatmentspoints, which might hinder the growth of soybean and accelerate senescence. KEGG analysis showed that at level 1, the DEGs were mainly enriched in photosynthesis-related, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction. At level 2 of secondary metabolism, the DEGs were mainly enriched in energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism pathways, which indicates that B stresses mainly affect photosynthesis, hormone regulation and amino acid metabolism of soybean, thus affecting plant growth. Through The above results, give deeper more comprehensive insights into the soybean response to B deficiency would be focused and lay a the foundation for the further studies of the molecular mechanism of soybean response to boron deficiency.",,

PRJNA776648,Glycine max,Expression analysis of reciprocal grafted of near-isogenic soybean lines under iron stress,"Iron stress response signaling between roots and shoots is not well understood in soybean. While studies have identified early responses to iron stress (as early as 30 minutes) the signaling pathway has not been well documented. In this study we used near-isogenic lines (Clark [Clk] and IsoClark [Iso]) to create four types of grafts (scion/roots), two homografts (Clk/Clk and Iso/Iso) and two heterografts (Clk/Iso and Iso/Clk). In hydroponics we subjected half the grafted seedlings to iron stress and collected leaf and root tissue after 30 and 120 minutes after iron stress; we extracted and sequenced RNA from the tissue samples. We identified differentially expressed genes and differences in expression patterns between grafting combinations. These results support the hypothesis that the physiological and molecular iron stress response is determined by the root genotype.",,

Recently, we reported a newly developed LP soybean line with normal emergence, growth, and yield when compared to the Natto-kotsubu (Natto) cultivar. The RNA-Seq was used to investigate the mechanism underlying reduction in phytic acid levels without impact to physiological characteristics in this LP line. an intron retention (IR) event was detected in inositol-1,3,4 trisphosphate 5/6-kinase 3 (GmITPK3) in LP leaves compared to the reference transcriptome and 34 % of the isoform belonged to an IR isoform. The PCR amplification results showed the LP line produced abundant IR transcripts (IRTs) compared to Natto cultivar and NP line. The predicted amino acid (AA) of IR may have no function compared to the non-intron retention transcript (nIRT). The abundance of each IRTs was changed during seeds development may maintain the phytic acid level in Natto cultivar, however, the abundant of IRTs produced in LP line may perturb the phosphorylation of InsP4 to InsP5 and/or create a negative feedback effect on InsP4 and InsP3 synthesis, leading to reduced phytic acid levels in the LP line during seed development. Hence, the GmITPK3 mutant might involve the decrease the level of phytic acid in seeds without harming the plants, thus representing a new strategy for LP crop development.",,
PRJNA910939,Northeast Agricultural University,547 soybean accessions resequencing data,"Resequencing data of 547 soybean accessions, these were mainly originated from northeast part of China.",10.1111/pbi.14222,"Soybean is one of the most economically important crops worldwide and an important source of unsaturated fatty acids and protein for the human diet. Consumer demand for healthy fats and oils is increasing, and the global demand for vegetable oil is expected to double by 2050. Identification of key genes that regulate seed fatty acid content can facilitate molecular breeding of high-quality soybean varieties with enhanced fatty acid profiles. Here, we analysed the genetic architecture underlying variations in soybean seed fatty acid content using 547 accessions, including mainly landraces and cultivars from northeastern China. Through fatty acid profiling, genome re-sequencing, population genomics analyses, and GWAS, we identified a SEIPIN homologue at the FA9 locus as an important contributor to seed fatty acid content. Transgenic and multiomics analyses confirmed that FA9 was a key regulator of seed fatty acid content with pleiotropic effects on seed protein and seed size. We identified two major FA9 haplotypes in 1295 resequenced soybean accessions and assessed their phenotypic effects in a field planting of 424 accessions. Soybean accessions carrying FA9<sup>H2</sup> had significantly higher total fatty acid contents and lower protein contents than those carrying FA9<sup>H1</sup> . FA9<sup>H2</sup> was absent in wild soybeans but present in 13% of landraces and 26% of cultivars, suggesting that it may have been selected during soybean post-domestication improvement. FA9 therefore represents a useful genetic resource for molecular breeding of high-quality soybean varieties with specific seed storage profiles."

After 12 hours, the sites of inoculation were excised from the hypocotyls and frozen for RNA extraction. Phytophthora sojae mycelia used for inoculation was saved for RNA extraction also Overall design: Four replicate experiments were conducted. Each replicate consisted of 30 P. sojae-inoculated or mock-inoculated hypocotyls, as well as a sample of the P. sojae mycelia used for the 30 inoculations",34691104,"<i>Phytophthora sojae</i> is an oomycete that causes stem and root rot disease in soybean. <i>P. sojae</i> delivers many RxLR effector proteins, including Avr1b, into host cells to promote infection. We show here that Avr1b interacts with the soybean U-box protein, GmPUB1-1, in yeast two-hybrid, pull down, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) assays. <i>GmPUB1-1</i>, and a homeologous copy <i>GmPUB1-2</i>, are induced by infection and encode 403 amino acid proteins with U-Box domains at their N-termini. Non-synonymous mutations in the Avr1b C-terminus that abolish suppression of cell death also abolished the interaction of Avr1b with GmPUB1-1, while deletion of the GmPUB1-1 C-terminus, but not the U box, abolished the interaction. BIFC experiments suggested that the GmPUB1-1-Avr1b complex is targeted to the nucleus. <i>In vitro</i> ubiquitination assays demonstrated that GmPUB1-1 possesses E3 ligase activity. Silencing of the <i>GmPUB1</i> genes in soybean cotyledons resulted in loss of recognition of Avr1b by gene products encoded by <i>Rps1</i>-b and <i>Rps1</i>-k. The recognition of Avr1k (which did not interact with GmPUB1-1) by <i>Rps1</i>-k plants was not, however, affected following <i>GmPUB1</i>-<i>1</i> silencing. Furthermore, over-expression of GmPUB1-1 in particle bombardment experiments triggered cell death suggesting that GmPUB1 may be a positive regulator of effector-triggered immunity. In a yeast two-hybrid system, GmPUB1-1 also interacted with a number of other RxLR effectors including Avr1d, while Avr1b and Avr1d interacted with a number of other infection-induced GmPUB proteins, suggesting that the pathogen uses a multiplex of interactions of RxLR effectors with GmPUB proteins to modulate host immunity."
PRJNA731151,Glycine max,Identification of plant viruses in soybean by metagenomic sequencing,"Viruses negatively impact soybean production by causing disease that affect yield and seed quality. Newly emerging or re-emerging viruses can also threaten soybean production, because current control measures may not be effective against them. Furthermore, detection and characterization of new plant viruses requires major efforts when no sequence or antibody-based resources are available. In this study, soybean fields were scouted for virus-like disease symptoms during 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. Total RNA was extracted from symptomatic soybean tissues collected individually. cDNA libraries were prepared and RNA sequencing was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) Illumina HiSeq3000 (Illumina, https://www.illumina.com/) to generate paired-end reads (HiSeq: 2 * 150 bp, 2 lanes). After removal of soybean reads, the short-reads were de novo assembled using the Trinity assembler. Through metagenomics approaches, several viruses were detected and identified as single or mixed infections in soybean. De novo assemblies generated full- or nearly full-length genomes in soybean. Taken together, the results of this study showed that NGS-based technology is a valuable diagnostic tool for the identification of several viruses in field-grown soybean, and can provide rapid information about plant viruses that were previously not detected in soybean fields.",36100874,

While these organs share some morphological and developmental similarities, whether legume nodules are modified lateral roots is an open question. We dissected emerging nodules (EN), mature nodules (MN), emerging lateral roots (ELR) and young lateral roots (YLR), and constructed strand-specific RNAseq libraries using polyA-enriched RNA preparations. Root sections above and below these organs devoid of any lateral organs were used to construct respective control tissue libraries (ABEN, ABMN, ABELR, ABYLR respectively). High sequence quality, predominant mapping to coding sequences, and consistency between replicates indicated that the RNAseq libraries were of very high quality. We identified genes enriched in emerging nodules, mature nodules, emerging lateral roots and young lateral roots in soybean by comparing global gene expression profiles between each of these organs and adjacent root segments. Potential uses for this high quality transcriptome data set include generation of global gene regulatory networks to identify key regulators; metabolic pathway analyses and comparative analysis of key gene families to discover organ-specific biological processes; and identification of organ-specific alternate spliced transcripts. When combined with other similar datasets especially from leguminous plants these analyses can help answer questions on the evolutionary origins of root nodules and relationships between the development of different plant lateral organs. Overall design: Three replicate samples were harvested for each of the eight tissue types for the preparation of twenty four RNAseq libraries.",,

The release of the last soybean <i>(Glycine max)</i> genome assembly (Wm82.a2.v1) raised the possibility that new NAC genes would be present in the soybean genome. Here, we interrogated the last version of the soybean genome against a conserved NAC domain structure. Our analysis identified 32 putative novel NAC genes, updating the superfamily to 180 gene members. We also organized the genes in 15 phylogenetic subfamilies, which showed a perfect correlation among sequence conservation, expression profile, and function of orthologous <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> genes and NAC soybean genes. To validate our <i>in silico</i> analyses, we monitored the stress-mediated gene expression profiles of eight new NAC-genes by qRT-PCR and monitored the GmNAC senescence-associated genes by RNA-seq. Among ER stress, osmotic stress and salicylic acid treatment, all the novel tested GmNAC genes responded to at least one type of stress, displaying a complex expression profile under different kinetics and extension of the response. Furthermore, we showed that 40% of the GmNACs were differentially regulated by natural leaf senescence, including eight (8) newly identified GmNACs. The developmental and stress-responsive expression profiles of the novel NAC genes fitted perfectly with their phylogenetic subfamily. Finally, we examined two uncharacterized senescence-associated proteins, GmNAC065 and GmNAC085, and a novel, previously unidentified, NAC protein, GmNAC177, and showed that they are nuclear localized, and except for GmNAC065, they display transactivation activity in yeast. Consistent with a role in leaf senescence, transient expression of GmNAC065 and GmNAC085 induces the appearance of hallmarks of leaf senescence, including chlorophyll loss, leaf yellowing, lipid peroxidation and accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. GmNAC177 was clustered to an uncharacterized subfamily but in close proximity to the TIP subfamily. Accordingly, it was rapidly induced by ER stress and by salicylic acid under late kinetic response and promoted cell death <i>in planta</i>. Collectively, our data further substantiated the notion that the GmNAC genes display functional and expression profiles consistent with their phylogenetic relatedness and established a complete framework of the soybean NAC superfamily as a foundation for future analyses."

Furthermore, detection and characterization of new plant viruses requires major efforts when no sequence or antibody-based resources are available. In this study, soybean fields were scouted for virus-like disease symptoms during 2016 growing season. Total RNA was extracted from symptomatic soybean tissues collected individually. cDNA libraries were prepared and RNA sequencing was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) Illumina HiSeq3000 (Illumina, https://www.illumina.com/) to generate paired-end reads (HiSeq: 2 * 150 bp, 2 lanes). After removal of soybean reads, the short-reads were de novo assembled using the Trinity assembler. Through metagenomics approaches, several viruses were detected and identified as single or mixed infections in soybean. De novo assemblies generated full- or nearly full-length genomes in soybean. Taken together, the results of this study showed that NGS-based technology is a valuable diagnostic tool for the identification of several viruses in field-grown soybean, and can provide rapid information about plant viruses that were previously not detected in soybean fields.",36100874,

Two biological replicates of RNA-seq were included for Zn-sufficient leaves (ZSL), Zn-deficient leaves (ZDL), Zn-sufficient roots (ZSR), and Zn-deficient roots (ZDR). Therefore a total of eight libraries were constructed. Using a 2-fold change and a P-value ≤0.05 as the cut-off for selecting the differentially expressed transcripts, we globally identified Zn-deficiency responsive genes. At least 20 genes that are potentially involved Zn homeostasis were significantly changed by Zn deficiency, including 7 ZIP (ZRT, IRT-related protein) transporter genes, 3 nicotianamine synthase genes, and 7 metallothionein genes. At least 48 genes encoding likely Zn-binding proteins were found to be responsive to Zn deficiency in leaves or roots. Eighty-five transcription factor genes were significantly changed by Zn deficiency in leaves or roots, including 5 bZIP members and 10 Golden 2-like members. In addition, some other groups of genes which are possibly related to reactive oxygen species scavenging, calcium and hormone signaling, and protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation also differentially expressed under Zn deficiency. Overall design: The first trifoliate true leaves and roots of soybean were harvested after 12 days treatment with or without zinc element in the nutrient solution, and RNA was extracted and sequenced by paired-end sequencing.

Overall design: RNAseq from developing Glycine max seeds from stage 7.1 (mid-seedfilling) to final maturation,28700604,"Seed longevity, defined as the ability to remain alive during storage, is an important agronomic factor. Poor longevity negatively impacts seedling establishment and consequently crop yield. This is particularly problematic for soybean as seeds have a short lifespan. While the economic importance of soybean has fueled a large number of transcriptome studies during embryogenesis and seed filling, the mechanisms regulating seed longevity during late maturation remain poorly understood. Here, a detailed physiological and molecular characterization of late seed maturation was performed in soybean to obtain a comprehensive overview of the regulatory genes that are potentially involved in longevity. Longevity appeared at physiological maturity at the end of seed filling before maturation drying and progressively doubled until the seeds reached the dry state. The increase in longevity was associated with the expression of genes encoding protective chaperones such as heat shock proteins and the repression of nuclear and chloroplast genes involved in a range of chloroplast activities, including photosynthesis. An increase in the raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO)/sucrose ratio together with changes in RFO metabolism genes was also associated with longevity. A gene co-expression network analysis revealed 27 transcription factors whose expression profiles were highly correlated with longevity. Eight of them were previously identified in the longevity network of Medicago truncatula, including homologues of ERF110, HSF6AB, NFXL1 and members of the DREB2 family. The network also contained several transcription factors associated with auxin and developmental cell fate during flowering, organ growth and differentiation. A transcriptional transition occurred concomitant with seed chlorophyll loss and detachment from the mother plant, suggesting the activation of a post-abscission program. This transition was enriched with AP2/EREBP and WRKY transcription factors and genes associated with growth, germination and post-transcriptional processes, suggesting that this program prepares the seed for the dry quiescent state and germination."

The three mutants include a gnarled trichome mutant (known as R55C01 or FN0175501), a high seed protein mutant (known as R15C01 or FN0171501) and a short petiole architecture mutant (known as ‘Christmas tree’, 6R44C72 or FN0164472). Genetic mapping of the gnarled trichome mutant using whole genome sequence-based bulked segregant analysis identified a 26.6 megabase interval on chromosome 20 that co-segregates with the phenotype. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of the mutant indicated that the chromosome 20 interval included a small structural variant within the coding region of a soybean ortholog (Glyma.20G019300) of Arabidopsis Nck-Associated Protein 1 (NAP1), an important regulator of actin nucleation during trichome morphogenesis. Sequence analysis of the candidate allele revealed multiple rearrangements within the coding region, including two deletions (approximately 1-2 kb each), a translocation, and an inversion. Further analyses revealed that the mutated allele perfectly co-segregated with the phenotype, and a wild-type soybean NAP1 transgene functionally complemented the Arabidopsis nap1 mutant (grl-4). Additionally, mapping and exon sequencing of NAP1 in a spontaneous soybean gnarled trichome mutant (T31) identified a frame shift mutation resulting in a truncation of the coding region. These data indicate that the soybean NAP1 gene is essential for proper trichome development and that the soybean gnarled phenotype resulted from complex structural rearrangements induced by fast neutron mutagenesis at the NAP1 locus",,

In the present study, we profiled gene expression changes, alternative splicing events, and DNA methylation patterns during nodule formation, development, and senescence. The transcriptome data uncovered key transcription patterns of nodule development that included 9669 core genes and 7302 stage-specific genes. Alternative splicing analysis uncovered a total of 2323 genes that undergo alternative splicing events in at least one nodule developmental stage, with activation of exon skipping and repression of intron retention being the most common splicing events in nodules compared to roots. Approximately 40% of the differentially spliced genes were also differentially expressed at the same nodule developmental stage, implying a substantial association between gene expression and alternative splicing. Genome-wide-DNA methylation analysis revealed dynamic changes in nodule methylomes that were specific to each nodule stage, occurred in a sequence-specific manner, and impacted the expression of 1864 genes. An attractive hypothesis raised by our data is that increased DNA methylation may contribute to the efficiency of alternative splicing.

Changes in gene expression were correlated with agronomic traits. Overall design: RNA was isolated from leaf matrial harvested from the field in july of 2015. Four replicates were grown at two location in a random complete block design. Each samples is represented from three or four replications form each location,28493991,"Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] genetic diversity is limited because domesticated soybean has undergone multiple genetic bottlenecks. Its progenitor, the wild soybean [Glycine soja Siebold &amp; Zucc], has not undergone the same intense selection and is much more genetically diverse than domesticated soybean. However, the agronomic importance of diversity in wild soybean is unclear, and its weedy nature makes assessment difficult. To address this issue, we chose for study a highly selected, adapted F4-derived progeny of wild soybean, NMS4-44-329. This breeding line is derived from the hybridization between G. max cultivar N7103 and G. soja PI 366122. Agronomic comparisons were made among N7103, NMS4-44-329 and their F1 and F2 progeny in replicated yield trials at two North Carolina locations. Significant F1 mid-parent heterosis was observed at each location for seed yield (189 and 223 kgha-1, P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.10, respectively), seed protein content (1.1g/100g, P&lt;0.01) and protein production per hectare (101 and 100 kgha-1, P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.06, respectively). Increased yield, seed protein content and protein production per hectare in the hybrids suggested that wild soybean has the potential to improve agronomic traits in applied breeding. Comparisons of differentially-expressed genes in the hybrid vs. parents identified genes associated with N metabolism. Non-additive changes in gene expression in the hybrids relative to the parents could reasonably explain the improved protein levels in the F1 hybrids. Changes in gene expression were influenced by environmental effects; however, allele specific bias in the hybrids were well correlated between environments. We propose that changes in gene expression, both additive and non-additive, and changes in allele specific expression bias may explain agronomic traits, and be valuable tools for plant breeders in the assessment of breeding populations."

Therefore, we performed RNA sequencing on SMV-infected resistant and susceptible soybean lines to determine the molecular mechanism of resistance to SMV. When the clean reads were aligned to the <i>G. max</i> reference genome, a total of 36,260 genes were identified as expressed genes and used for further research. Most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with resistance were found to be enriched in plant hormone signal transduction and circadian rhythm according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. In addition to salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, which are well known in plant disease resistance, abscisic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, and cytokinin are also involved in the immune response to SMV in soybean. Most of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling related DEGs enriched in plant-pathogen interaction negatively influence SMV resistance. Furthermore, the MAPK cascade was involved in either resistant or susceptible responses to SMV, depending on different downstream proteins.

Our previous studies revealed that the transcription factors GmMYB29A2 and GmNAC42-1 have essential roles in activating glyceollin biosynthesis, yet each cannot activate the transcription of all biosynthesis genes in the absence of a pathogen elicitor treatment. Here, we report that co-overexpressing both transcription factors is also insufficient to activate glyceollin biosynthesis. To understand this insufficiency, we compared the transcriptome profiles of hairy roots overexpressing each transcription factor with glyceollin-synthesizing roots treated with wall glucan elicitor (WGE) from <i>P. sojae</i>. GmMYB29A2 upregulated most of the WGE-regulated genes that encode enzymatic steps spanning from primary metabolism to the last step of glyceollin biosynthesis. By contrast, GmNAC42-1 upregulated glyceollin biosynthesis genes only when overexpressed in the presence of WGE treatment. This is consistent with our recent discovery that, in the absence of WGE, GmNAC42-1 is bound by GmJAZ1 proteins that inhibit its transactivation activity. WGE, and not GmMYB29A2 or GmNAC42-1, upregulated the heat shock family gene <i>GmHSF6-1</i>, the homolog of Arabidopsis <i>HSFB2a</i> that directly activated the transcription of several glyceollin biosynthesis genes.

Firstly, the germination potential of LX was investigated which confirmed the previous report that LX germinated better at drought stress conditions. Additionally, LX plants accumulated more anthocyanin at both normal and stress conditions, and exhibited better resistance to drought treatment comparing to William82. When grown at the same condition, the LX plants are greener than control lines and contain more chlorophyll. Collection of biochemical measurements all indicated that LX is more physiologically adaptive to stress conditions. Using untargeted mass spectrometry analysis in combination with transcriptomics analysis, we revealed the chemical diversity and genetic basis underlying the overall performance of LX landrace at the designed growth conditions. Under both normal and stress conditions, significant differences in the expressions of a suite of secondary metabolism genes, particularly the genes from general phenylpropanoid pathway, were detected in LX comparing to William82 plants. Consistently, correlating with the transcript analysis, a set of corresponding secondary metabolites with profoundly different accumulations were also detected in LX plants.

We validated the predicted regulatory network by comparing it with published regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis. Some regulatory interactions were found in the low phytic acid mutants but not in non-mutant plants. These findings provide important hypotheses on expression regulation of myo-inositol metabolism, and phytohormone signaling in developing low phytic acid soybeans.

Overall design: Four soybean experimental lines designated as: (i) 3mlpa, (ii) 3MWT, (iii) 1mlpa, and (iv) 1MWT were used in this study. The lpa mutant line, ‘3mlpa’, carrying three mutations mips1/mrp-l/mrp-n, and its non-mutant sibling line with normal phytic acid, ‘3MWT’, were derived from crossing of ‘CX-1834’ (lpa line with two mpr-l/mrp-n mutations on soybean chromosomes 19 and 3, respectively) with ‘V99-5089’ (lpa line with single mips1 mutation) (Saghai Maroof et al., 2009). Another lpa line, ‘1mlpa’, carrying a single mips1 mutation on soybean chromosome 11, and its isogenic sibling line with normal phytic acid, ‘1MWT’, were derived from crossing of ‘Essex’ (a normal phytic acid line with no mutations) with V99-5089 (Saghai Maroof and Buss, 2008; Glover, 2011). Developing seeds were sampled in triplicates for each experimental soybean line based on seed lengths corresponding to 2-4 mm (stage1), 4-6 mm (stage2), 6-8 mm (stage3), 8-10 mm (stage4), and 10-12 mm (stage5), respectively. Samples were flash frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. High-quality total RNA (RIN 9-10) was extracted from frozen samples using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit, with on-column DNase digestion (QIAGEN). Total of 60 mRNA libraries were prepared from total RNA samples and sequenced as 100SE using HiSeq2000.

To understand the regulatory mechanisms and identify key genes that intervene in the seed development process in low phytic acid crops, we performed computational inference of gene regulatory networks in low and normal phytic acid soybeans using a time course transcriptomic data and multiple network inference algorithms.

In order to evaluate whether the expression of ATWRI1 and AtDGAT1 could direct carbon flow towards lipid accumulation, we generated three independent transformation events (WD-1, -2, and -3). The transgenic events were evaluated in three field trials (2018, 2019, and 2020) as well as greenhouse conditions. RNAseq analysis was performed in immature embryos of both transgenic events grown under greenhouse conditions. We discovered that Glycolysis and FA metabolism enzymes are enriched in WD differentially expressed genes during seed development. Overall design: To check the response of the expression of Arabidopsis WRI1 and DGAT1 during soybean embryo development to alter oil and carbohydrate composition in seeds",35306726,"Soybean oil is one of the most consumed vegetable oils worldwide. Genetic improvement of its concentration in seeds has been historically pursued due to its direct association with its market value. Engineering attempts aiming to increase soybean seed oil presented different degrees of success that varied with the genetic design and the specific variety considered. Understanding the embryo's responses to the genetic modifications introduced, is a critical step to successful approaches. In this work, the metabolic and transcriptional responses to AtWRI1 and AtDGAT1 expression in soybean seeds were evaluated. AtWRI1 is a master regulator of fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis, and AtDGAT1 encodes an enzyme catalysing the final and rate-limiting step of triacylglycerides biosynthesis. The events expressing these genes in the embryo did not show an increase in total FA content, but they responded with changes in the oil and carbohydrate composition. Transcriptomic studies revealed a down-regulation of genes putatively encoding for oil body packaging proteins, and a strong induction of genes annotated as lipases and FA biosynthesis inhibitors. Novel putative AtWRI1 targets, presenting an AW-box in the upstream region of the genes, were identified by comparison with an event that harbours only AtWRI1. Lastly, targeted metabolomics analysis showed that carbon from sugar phosphates could be used for FA competing pathways, such as starch and cell wall polysaccharides, contributing to the restriction in oil accumulation. These results allowed the identification of key cellular processes that need to be considered to break the embryo's natural restriction to uncontrolled seed lipid increase."

Overall design: Soybean unifoliolate mRNA profiles of 11-day-old Williams82 seedlings under the circadian condition were generated by HiSeq in triplicates,31676549,"The plant circadian clock evolved to increase fitness by synchronizing physiological processes with environmental oscillations. Crop fitness was artificially selected through domestication and breeding, and the circadian clock was identified by both natural and artificial selections as a key to improved fitness. Despite progress in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, our understanding of the crop circadian clock is still limited, impeding its rational improvement for enhanced fitness. To unveil the interactions between the crop circadian clock and various environmental cues, we comprehensively mapped abiotic stress inputs to the soybean circadian clock using a 2-module discovery pipeline. Using the ""molecular timetable"" method, we computationally surveyed publicly available abiotic stress-related soybean transcriptomes to identify stresses that have strong impacts on the global rhythm. These findings were then experimentally confirmed using a multiplexed RNA sequencing technology. Specific clock components modulated by each stress were further identified. This comprehensive mapping uncovered inputs to the plant circadian clock such as alkaline stress. Moreover, short-term iron deficiency targeted different clock components in soybean and <i>Arabidopsis</i> and thus had opposite effects on the clocks of these 2 species. Comparing soybean varieties with different iron uptake efficiencies suggests that phase modulation might be a mechanism to alleviate iron deficiency symptoms in soybean. These unique responses in soybean demonstrate the need to directly study crop circadian clocks. Our discovery pipeline may serve as a broadly applicable tool to facilitate these explorations."

Using a temporal, comparative transcriptome-based approach, we observed that early gene expression profiles of root tissue from infected maize suggest that pathogen tolerance coincides with the rapid induction of senescence dampening transcriptional regulators, including ANACs (Arabidopsis thaliana NAM/ATAF/CUC protein) and Ethylene-Responsive Factors. In contrast, the expression of senescence-associated processes in soybean was coincident with the appearance of disease symptom development, suggesting pathogen-induced senescence as a key pathway driving pathogen susceptibility in soybean. Based on the analyses described herein, we posit that root senescence is a primary contributing factor underlying colonization and disease progression in symptomatic versus asymptomatic host-fungal interactions. This process also supports the lifestyle and virulence of F. virguliforme during biotrophy to necrotrophy transitions. Further support for this hypothesis lies in comprehensive co-expression and comparative transcriptome analyses, and in total, supports the emerging concept of necrotrophy-activated senescence. We propose that F. virguliforme conditions an environment within symptomatic hosts, which favors susceptibility through transcriptomic reprogramming, and as described herein, the induction of pathways associated with senescence during the necrotrophic stage of fungal development."

We show that basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor genes represented by Glyma04g41710 and its paralogs are required for the formation of stoma in leaves and stomatal precursor complexes in mature embryo cotyledons. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these bHLH transcription factor genes are orthologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) SPEECHLESS (SPCH) that initiate asymmetric cell divisions in the leaf protoderm layer and establish stomatal cell lineages. Soybean SPCH (GmSPCH) mRNAs accumulate primarily in embryo, seedling, and leaf epidermal layers. Expression of Glyma04g41710 under the control of the SPCH promoter rescues the Arabidopsis spch mutant, indicating that Glyma04g41710 is a functional ortholog of SPCH. Developing soybean embryos do not form mature stoma, and stomatal differentiation is arrested at the guard mother cell stage. We analyzed the accumulation of GmSPCH mRNAs during soybean seed development and mRNAs orthologous to MUTE, FAMA, and inducer of C-repeat/dehydration responsive element-binding factor expression1/scream2 that are required for stoma formation in Arabidopsis. The mRNA accumulation patterns provide a potential explanation for guard mother cell dormancy in soybean embryos. Our results suggest that variation in the timing of bHLH transcription factor gene expression can explain the diversity of stomatal forms observed during plant development."

Evening Complex (EC) components soybean LUX1, LUX2, and ELF3a are critical for flowering and adaptation to lower latitudes. However, the mechanisms of EC in regulating flowering time remain largely unclear in soybean. Here, we identified GmJMJ19 and GmJMJ20 gene paralogs encoding JmjC-domain containing proteins, which co-express and interact with GmLUX2. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that GmJMJ19 and GmJMJ20 bind to histone, but lack histone demethylase activity. Notably, simultaneous mutation of GmJMJ19 and GmJMJ20 causes delayed flowering time. Further transcriptomic, CUT&amp;Tag and ChIP-seq analyses show that GmJMJ19/20 and GmLUX2 primarily co-repress transcription of 168 genes, which are not associated with the alternation of examined histone methylation state. Strikingly, we identify that the direct repression of GmSVP by GmJMJ19/20-GmLUX2 module is independent of the classical EC-E1 pathway. Interestingly, haplotype analyses support the idea that GmJMJ19 might undergo selection during soybean expansion to lower latitude. In summary, our findings reveal a mechanistic insight of GmJMJ19/20-GmLUX2 into flowering time control beyond EC complex in plants and also provide resources for improving soybean adaptability through molecular breeding.

The Rag2  gene of soybean provides resistance to soybean aphid biotypes I and II. Transcriptomic analyses were performed on near isogenic lines (NILs) with the Rag2 allele for aphid resistance or rag2 for susceptibility at the Rag2 locus. Soybeans were infested with soybean aphids and leaves were collected at 0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours after infestation. RNA were extracted and a high throughput RNA-seq approach was used to examine mRNA expression in Rag2 and rag2 soybean leaves. The expression of ~43,000 genes was detected in both the Rag2 and rag2 leaves. Statistical analysis identified 2361 genes significantly regulated between the resistant and susceptible lines at different times after aphid infestation.

The release of the soybean genome fuelled several transcriptome projects comprising multiple developmental stages and environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the global transcriptional patterns of embryonic axes during germination remain unknown. Here we report the analysis of ~1.58 billion RNA-Seq reads from soybean embryonic axes at five germination stages. Our results support the early activation of processes that are critical for germination, such as glycolysis, Krebs cycle and cell wall remodelling. Strikingly, only 3&#x2009;hours after imbibition there is a preferential up-regulation of protein kinases and transcription factors, particularly from the LOB domain family, implying that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation play major roles early after imbibition. Lipid mobilization and glyoxylate pathways are also transcriptionally active in the embryonic axes, indicating that the local catabolism of oil reserves in the embryonic axes contributes to energy production during germination. We also present evidence supporting abscisic acid inactivation and the up-regulation of gibberellin, ethylene and brassinosteroid pathways. Further, there is a remarkable differential activation of paralogous genes in these hormone signalling pathways. Taken together, our results provide insights on the regulation and biochemistry of soybean germination."

The soybean orthologue of MPK kinase2 (GmMKK2) was recently identified as a potential signalling node whose expression is upregulated in the feeding site induced by soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines). To investigate the role of GmMKK2 in soybean-SCN interactions, we overexpressed a catabolically inactive variant referred to as kinase-dead variant (KD-GmMKK2) using transgenic hairy roots. KD-GmMKK2 overexpression caused significant reduction in soybean susceptibility to SCN, while overexpression of the wild-type variant (WT-GmMKK2) exhibited no effect on susceptibility. Transcriptome analysis indicated that KD-GmMKK2 overexpressing plants are primed for SCN resistance via constitutive activation of defence signalling, particularly those related to chitin, respiratory burst, hydrogen peroxide and salicylic acid. Phosphoproteomic profiling of the WT-GmMKK2 and KD-GmMKK2 root samples upon SCN infection resulted in the identification of 391 potential targets of GmMKK2. These targets are involved in a broad range of biological processes, including defence signalling, vesicle fusion, chromatin remodelling and nuclear organization among others. Furthermore, GmMKK2 mediates phosphorylation of numerous transcriptional and translational regulators, pointing to the presence of signalling shortcuts besides the canonical MAPK cascades to initiate downstream signalling that eventually regulates gene expression and translation initiation. Finally, the functional requirement of specific phosphorylation sites for soybean response to SCN infection was validated by overexpressing phospho-mimic and phospho-dead variants of two differentially phosphorylated proteins SUN1 and IDD4. Together, our analyses identify GmMKK2 impacts on signalling modules that regulate soybean response to SCN infection."

Resistance mechanisms against SSR are poorly understood. We used high throughput RNAseq approach to decipher the molecular mechanisms governing resistance to S. sclerotiorum in soybean. Transcripts of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of soybean; susceptible (S) and resistant (R) were analyzed in a time course experiment. This study might provide an important step towards understanding resistance responses of soybean to S. sclerotiorum and identified novel mechanisms and targets. Overall design: Four-week-old soybean plants of both the resistant (R) and the susceptible (S) were inoculated using the cut petiole inoculation method as described by (Ranjan et.al., 2017; MPP., 19(3):700-714). Plant tissue was sampled by cutting horizontally above and below (1.5 cm) the node of the first trifoliate with a clean straight-edge razor. Tissue samples were collected at 24, 48, and 96 h post inoculation (hpi) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to RNA extraction. The stem tissue from non-inoculated (0 h) plants were also collected as a control. The experimental design was completely randomized and consisted of three biological replicates for each of the treatments. For each biological replicate, stem segments (~3 cm, first internode) from two different plants were pooled together. Soybean seedlings and plants were maintained in the greenhouse or growth chamber at 24 ± 2◦C with 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod cycle.

Transcripts and metabolites of two soybean recombinant inbred lines, one resistant and one susceptible to S.&#xa0;sclerotiorum were analysed in a time course experiment. The combined results show that resistance to S.&#xa0;sclerotiorum in soybean is associated in part with an early accumulation of JA-Ile ((+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine), a bioactive jasmonate, increased ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species, and importantly, a reprogramming of the phenylpropanoid pathway leading to increased antifungal activities. Indeed, we noted that phenylpropanoid pathway intermediates, such as 4-hydroxybenzoate, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid and caffeic acid, were highly accumulated in the resistant line. In vitro assays show that these metabolites and total stem extracts from the resistant line clearly affect S.&#xa0;sclerotiorum growth and development. Using chemical genomics in yeast, we further show that this antifungal activity targets ergosterol biosynthesis in the fungus, by disrupting enzymes involved in lipid and sterol biosynthesis. Overall, our results are consistent with a model where resistance to S.&#xa0;sclerotiorum in soybean coincides with an early recognition of the pathogen, leading to the modulation of the redox capacity of the host and the production of antifungal metabolites."

PRJNA478017,Glycine max,Glycine max Transcriptome or Gene expression,"Soybean aphids are phloem feeding insect pests of soybean. Aphids divert plant assimilates for their nutrition, causing yield losses of up to 50%. One of the management options for soybean aphids is cultivation of resistant soybean varieties. Aphid resistance in soybean is conferred by Resistance to Aphis glycines (Rag) genes with Rag1 and Rag2 being the most studied to date. Under insect attack, plants respond by inducing defenses which primarily consist of morphological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms. Previous studies showed that aphid populations were significantly lower in the double pyramid (Rag1Rag2) genotypes compared to soybean genotypes that contained the Rag1 or Rag2 gene alone. We hypothesized that pyramiding Rag1 and Rag2 in one soybean genotype had an additive or synergistic effect on aphid resistance at the molecular level. To test this idea, the transcriptional response of four near isogenic soybean genotypes (one aphid-susceptible and three aphid-resistant: Rag1, Rag2 and Rag1Rag2) to aphid feeding was measured at 6 and 12 hours, using RNA sequencing. Comparison of mock-treated samples versus aphid-treated samples for each soybean genotype showed that the transcriptional response to feeding by soybean aphids involved unique sets of genes and shared genes respectively at both time points. Biological processes modified due to aphid feeding were distinctive for each of the soybean genotypes at 6 hours but similar among them at the 12 hour time point. The transcriptional response of the Rag1Rag2 soybean genotype to feeding by soybean aphids at both time points involved unique sets of genes that were absent in the Rag1 or Rag2 response; suggesting that pyramiding the Rag1 and Rag2 genes in one soybean genotype has a synergistic effect on aphid resistance at the molecular level.

While resistance mechanisms against Phytophthora sojae have been extensively studied, the molecular basis underlying immune responses to the newly recognized pathogen, Phytophthora sansomeana, remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated transcriptomic and epigenetic responses of two resistant (Colfax and NE2701) and two susceptible (Williams 82 and Senaki) soybean lines at four time points (2, 4, 8, and 16 hours post inoculation, hpi) after P. sansomeana inoculation. Through comparative transcriptomic analyses, we identified a greater number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upon pathogen inoculation in the resistant lines compared to the susceptible lines, predominantly at 8 and 16 hpi. These DEGs were associated with multiple phytohormones, including ethylene, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid, along with various transcription factors and signaling cascade proteins. Moreover, DE transposable elements (TEs) were predominantly up-regulated after inoculation, and we found that TEs differentially transcribed in a resistant line were enriched near genes. Notably, we identified a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that was significantly differentially transcribed after inoculation exclusively in the resistant lines, potentially regulating two flanking LURP-one-related genes, known as key defense mediators in Arabidopsis against oomycete pathogens. Furthermore, DNA methylation analysis revealed increased CHH (H = A, T, or C) methylation levels in lncRNAs after inoculation, with delayed responses in the resistant line compared to the susceptible line. Overall, our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to P. sansomeana in soybean and underscore the potential role of lncRNAs and epigenetic regulation in plant defense responses. Overall design: We investigated transcriptomic responses of two resistant (Colfax and NE2701) and two susceptible (Williams 82 and Senaki) soybean lines at four time points (2, 4, 8, and 16 hours post inoculation, hpi) after P. sansomeana inoculation.",,

In the present work, a RNA-seq-based analysis was used for the first time to investigate the molecular aspect of the interaction of a partially resistant soybean genotype with non-pathogenic/pathogenic isolates of F. oxysporum at 72 and 96 hours post inoculation (hpi). Markedly different gene expression profiles were observed in compatible and incompatible host-pathogen combinations. A peak of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was observed at 72 hpi in soybean roots in response to both isolates, although the number of DEGs was about eight times higher for the pathogenic isolate compared to the non-pathogenic one (1,659 vs. 203 DEGs, respectively). Furthermore, not only the number of genes, but also the magnitude of induction was much greater in response to the pathogenic isolate. This response included a stronger activation of many well-known defense-related genes, and several genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, transcription factors, secondary and sugar metabolism. In addition, 1130 fungal genes were differentially expressed between the F. oxysporum isolates in planta during the infection process. Interestingly, 10% of these genes encode plant cell-wall degrading enzymes, reactive oxygen species-related enzymes and fungal proteins involved in primary metabolic pathways. Such information may be useful in the development of new methods of broadening resistance of soybean to F. oxysporum, including the silencing of important fungal genes, and also to understand the molecular basis of soybean-F. oxysporum interactions. Overall design: Soybean seedlings mRNA profiles inoculated with a non-pathogenic and pathogenic isolates of F. oxysporum and collected at 72 and 96 hpi, were generated using Illumina HiSeq 2500.

Understanding the regulatory mechanism of salt response is crucial for improving the salt tolerance of soybean. Here, we reveal a role for nuclear factor Y subunit GmNFYA in salt tolerance of soybean likely through the regulation of histone acetylation. GmNFYA is induced by salt stress. Overexpression of GmNFYA significantly enhances salt tolerance in stable transgenic soybean plants by inducing salt-responsive genes. Analysis in soybean plants with transgenic hairy roots also supports the conclusion. GmNFYA interacts with GmFVE, which functions with putative histone deacetylase GmHDA13 in a complex for transcriptional repression possibly by reducing H3K9 acetylation at target loci. Under salt stress, GmNFYA likely accumulates and competes with GmHDA13 for interaction with GmFVE, leading to the derepression and maintenance of histone acetylation for activation of salt-responsive genes and finally conferring salt tolerance in soybean plants. In addition, a haplotype I GmNFYA promoter is identified with the highest self-activated promoter activity and may be selected during future breeding for salt-tolerant cultivars. Our study uncovers the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of GmNFYA in salt-stress response, and all the factors/elements identified may be potential targets for genetic manipulation of salt tolerance in soybean and other crops."

PRJNA197379,Glycine max,Metabolic and Transcriptional Reprogramming in Developing Soybean (Glycine max) Embryos,"Soybean (Glycine max) seeds are an important source of seed storage compounds, including protein, oil, and sugar used for food, feed, chemical, and biofuel production. We assessed detailed temporal transcriptional and metabolic changes in developing soybean embryos to gain a systems biology view of developmental and metabolic changes and to identify potential targets for metabolic engineering. Two major developmental and metabolic transitions were captured enabling identification of potential metabolic engineering targets specific to seed filling and to desiccation. The first transition involved a switch between different types of metabolism in dividing and elongating cells. The second transition involved the onset of maturation and desiccation tolerance during seed filling and a switch from photoheterotrophic to heterotrophic metabolism. Clustering analyses of metabolite and transcript data revealed clusters of functionally related metabolites and transcripts active in these different developmental and metabolic programs. The gene clusters provide a resource to generate predictions about the associations and interactions of unknown regulators with their targets based on guilt-by-association relationships. The inferred regulators also represent potential targets for future metabolic engineering of relevant pathways and steps in central carbon and nitrogen metabolism in soybean embryos and drought and desiccation tolerance in plants. Overall design: Total mRNA profiles of 10 time course samples of Soybean developing embryos with three replicates per sample were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000",24833227,"Developing soybean seeds accumulate oils, proteins, and carbohydrates that are used as oxidizable substrates providing metabolic precursors and energy during seed germination. The accumulation of these storage compounds in developing seeds is highly regulated at multiple levels, including at transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. RNA sequencing was used to provide comprehensive information about transcriptional and post-transcriptional events that take place in developing soybean embryos. Bioinformatics analyses lead to the identification of different classes of alternatively spliced isoforms and corresponding changes in their levels on a global scale during soybean embryo development. Alternative splicing was associated with transcripts involved in various metabolic and developmental processes, including central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, induction of maturation and dormancy, and splicing itself. Detailed examination of selected RNA isoforms revealed alterations in individual domains that could result in changes in subcellular localization of the resulting proteins, protein-protein and enzyme-substrate interactions, and regulation of protein activities. Different isoforms may play an important role in regulating developmental and metabolic processes occurring at different stages in developing oilseed embryos."

We show that basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor genes represented by Glyma04g41710 and its paralogs are required for the formation of stoma in leaves and stomatal precursor complexes in mature embryo cotyledons. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these bHLH transcription factor genes are orthologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) SPEECHLESS (SPCH) that initiate asymmetric cell divisions in the leaf protoderm layer and establish stomatal cell lineages. Soybean SPCH (GmSPCH) mRNAs accumulate primarily in embryo, seedling, and leaf epidermal layers. Expression of Glyma04g41710 under the control of the SPCH promoter rescues the Arabidopsis spch mutant, indicating that Glyma04g41710 is a functional ortholog of SPCH. Developing soybean embryos do not form mature stoma, and stomatal differentiation is arrested at the guard mother cell stage. We analyzed the accumulation of GmSPCH mRNAs during soybean seed development and mRNAs orthologous to MUTE, FAMA, and inducer of C-repeat/dehydration responsive element-binding factor expression1/scream2 that are required for stoma formation in Arabidopsis. The mRNA accumulation patterns provide a potential explanation for guard mother cell dormancy in soybean embryos. Our results suggest that variation in the timing of bHLH transcription factor gene expression can explain the diversity of stomatal forms observed during plant development."

In most cold tolerant plants, the C-repeat/DRE Binding Factors (CBF/DREBs) are critical contributors to successful cold-responses; rapidly increasing following cold treatment and regulating the induction of many cold responsive genes. In soybean vegetative tissue, we found strong, transient accumulation of CBF transcripts in response to cold stress; however, the soybean transcripts of typical cold responsive genes (homologues to Arabidopsis genes such as dehydrins, ADH1, RAP2.1, and LEA14) were not significantly altered. Soybean CBFs were found to be functional, as when expressed constitutively in Arabidopsis they increased the levels of AtCOR47 and AtRD29a transcripts and increased freezing tolerance as measured by a decrease in leaf freezing damage and ion leakage. Furthermore the constitutive expression of GmDREB1A;2 and GmDREB1B;1 in Arabidopsis led to stronger up-regulation of downstream genes and more freezing tolerance than GmDREB1A;1, the gene whose transcript is the major contributor to total CBF/DREB1 transcripts in soybean. The inability for the soybean CBFs to significantly up regulate the soybean genes that contribute to cold tolerance is consistent with poor acclimation capability and the cold intolerance of soybean."

It has been suggested that AS varies dramatically among species, tissues, and duplicated gene families of different sizes. However, the genomic forces that govern AS variation remain poorly understood. Here, through genome-wide identification of AS events in the soybean (Glycine max) genome using high-throughput RNA sequencing of 28 samples from different developmental stages, we found that more than 63% of multiexonic genes underwent AS. More AS events occurred in the younger developmental stages than in the older developmental stages for the same type of tissue, and the four main AS types, exon skipping, intron retention, alternative donor sites, and alternative acceptor sites, exhibited different characteristics. Global computational analysis demonstrated that the variations of AS frequency and AS types were significantly correlated with the changes of gene features and gene transcriptional level. Further investigation suggested that the decrease of AS within the genome-wide duplicated genes were due to the diminution of intron length, exon number, and transcriptional level. Altogether, our study revealed that a large number of genes were alternatively spliced in the soybean genome and that variations in gene structure and transcriptional level may play important roles in regulating AS."

PRJNA564957,A Transcriptional Regulatory Network of Rsv3-mediated Extreme Resistance Against Soybean Mosaic Virus,A Transcriptional Regulatory Network of Rsv3-mediated Extreme Resistance Against Soybean Mosaic Virus,"Resistance (R) genes are very effective for disease control in plants. Current research shows that R genes predominantly function by inducing a hypersensitive reaction (HR), which results in localized cell death thought to restrict pathogen spread. Some R genes elicit a more atypical response where resistance is not associated with HR or the associated gene expression changes, termed extreme resistance (ER). The molecular regulatory mechanism underlying ER is largely unexplored. One of the few known, naturally occurring, instances of ER is resistance derived from the soybean Rsv3 gene, which confers resistance against the most virulent strains of soybean mosaic virus (SMV). To discern the regulatory mechanism underlying the Rsv3-mediated ER reaction, we generated a gene regulatory network using transcriptomic data from a time course comparison of SMV-G7-infected resistant (L29, Rsv3-genotype) and susceptible (Williams82, rsv3-genotype) soybean cultivars. We identified putative interactions between transcription factors (TFs) regulating gene expression in hormone regulatory pathways, such as abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA). This is consistent with the demonstrated involvement of these pathways in Rsv3-mediated resistance. We found significant enrichment for the G-box motif (“CACGTG”) among genes implicated in ABA- and JA-related activities. This motif is specifically recognized by MYC2, which is a master regulator of ABA and JA signaling. Our network identified a MYC2 TF encoded by Glyma.07G051500 as a putative transcriptional regulator whose expression was significantly down-regulated in L29. This correlated with the down-regulation of expression of genes involved in ABA and JA processes. Our results suggest an important function for Glyma.07G051500 in ABA and JA derived defense signaling. Additionally, our regulatory network found other putative TFs with differential expression, such as MYBs and ERFs, which may also be involved in regulating ABA and JA signaling for defense. The regulatory network presented here offers new insights into the regulation of the molecular defense mechanism underlying Rsv3-mediated ER against SMV. Overall design: The soybean cultivars ‘L29’ (Rsv3-genotype; resistant) and ‘Williams82’ (rsv3-genotype; susceptible) were used in this study. The Rsv3-genotype confers ER to the most virulent strains of SMV. Thus the goal of this study was to investigate the regulation of the Rsv3-mediated ER molecular defense mechanism against SMV. Plants were grown in controlled greenhouse conditions and inoculated at first, fully, expanded trifoliolate stage with SMV strain G7 (SMV-G7). Unifoliolate leaves were dusted with carborundum powder and rubbed with SMV-G7 inoculum. The inoculated unifoliolate leaves were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post inoculation (hpi) and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. High-quality total RNA (RNA &gt;7.0) was extracted from frozen samples using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) with on-column DNase digestion (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). A total of 20 mRNA libraries (= 2 cultivars x 5 time-points x 2 biological replicates) were prepared from duplicate RNA samples of each line at each time point and sequenced as 150PE with Illumina HiSeq4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at Novogene, Sacramento, CA.",32315334,"Resistance genes are an effective means for disease control in plants. They predominantly function by inducing a hypersensitive reaction, which results in localized cell death restricting pathogen spread. Some resistance genes elicit an atypical response, termed extreme resistance, where resistance is not associated with a hypersensitive reaction and its standard defense responses. Unlike hypersensitive reaction, the molecular regulatory mechanism(s) underlying extreme resistance is largely unexplored. One of the few known, naturally occurring, instances of extreme resistance is resistance derived from the soybean Rsv3 gene, which confers resistance against the most virulent Soybean mosaic virus strains. To discern the regulatory mechanism underlying Rsv3-mediated extreme resistance, we generated a gene regulatory network using transcriptomic data from time course comparisons of Soybean mosaic virus-G7-inoculated resistant (L29, Rsv3-genotype) and susceptible (Williams82, rsv3-genotype) soybean cultivars. Our results show Rsv3 begins mounting a defense by 6 hpi via a complex phytohormone network, where abscisic acid, cytokinin, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid pathways are suppressed. We identified putative regulatory interactions between transcription factors and genes in phytohormone regulatory pathways, which is consistent with the demonstrated involvement of these pathways in Rsv3-mediated resistance. One such transcription factor identified as a putative transcriptional regulator was MYC2 encoded by Glyma.07G051500. Known as a master regulator of abscisic acid and jasmonic acid signaling, MYC2 specifically recognizes the G-box motif (""CACGTG""), which was significantly enriched in our data among differentially expressed genes implicated in abscisic acid- and jasmonic acid-related activities. This suggests an important role for Glyma.07G051500 in abscisic acid- and jasmonic acid-derived defense signaling in Rsv3. Resultantly, the findings from our network offer insights into genes and biological pathways underlying the molecular defense mechanism of Rsv3-mediated extreme resistance against Soybean mosaic virus.

To investigate transcriptional changes in soybean roots in response to B. simplex Sneb45 treatment, transcriptome analysis and quantitative real-time PCR were conducted to detect and validate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In total, 19,109 DEGs were obtained. After B. simplex Sneb545 treatment, 970 and 1265 genes were up- and down-regulated at 5 days post-inoculation (dpi), respectively, and 142 and 47 genes were up- and down-regulated at 10 dpi, respectively, compared with untreated soybean roots. Functional annotation of DEGs indicated that B. simplex Sneb545 regulated soybean growth and defense against cyst nematode possibly through genes related to auxin, gibberellin, and NB-LRR protein. In addition, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that the DEGs were enriched in metabolism, signal transduction, and plant-pathogen interaction pathways. Moreover, the auxin and gibberellin contents were lower in B. simplex Sneb545-treated soybean roots than in untreated roots at 5 dpi. B. simplex Sneb545 possibly altered the expression of wound-induced protein and NAC transcription factor to regulate soybean growth and defense against cyst nematode.

PRJNA721706,Network Inference of Transcriptional Regulation in Germinating Low Phytic Acid Soybean Seeds,Network Inference of Transcriptional Regulation in Germinating Low Phytic Acid Soybean Seeds,"The low phytic acid trait in soybeans can be conferred by loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding myo-inositol phosphate synthase and two epistatically interacting genes encoding multidrug-resistance protein ABC transporters. However, perturbations in phytic acid biosynthesis are associated with poor seed vigor. Since the benefits of the low phytic acid trait, in terms of end-use quality and sustainability, far outweigh the negatives associated with poor seed performance, a fuller understanding of the molecular basis behind the negatives will assist crop breeders and engineers in producing variates with low phytic acid and better germination rate. The gene regulatory network for developing low and normal phytic acid soybean seeds was previously constructed, with genes modulating a variety of processes pertinent to phytic acid metabolism and seed viability being identified. In this study, a comparative time series analysis of low and normal phytic acid soybeans was carried out to investigate the transcriptional regulatory elements governing the transitional dynamics from dry seed to germinated seed. Gene regulatory networks were reverse engineered from time series transcriptomic data of three distinct genotypic subsets composed of low phytic acid soybean lines and their normal phytic acid sibling lines. Using a robust unsupervised network inference scheme, putative regulatory interactions were inferred for each subset of genotypes. These interactions were further validated by published regulatory interactions found in Arabidopsis thaliana and motif sequence analysis. Results indicate that low phytic acid seeds have increased sensitivity to stress, which could be due to changes in phytic acid levels, disrupted inositol phosphate signaling, disrupted phosphate ion homeostasis, and altered myo-inositol metabolism. Putative regulatory interactions were identified for the latter two processes. Changes in abscisic acid signaling candidate transcription factors putatively regulating genes in this process were identified as well. Analysis of the gene regulatory networks reveal altered regulation in processes that may be affecting the germination of low phytic acid soybean seeds. Therefore, this work contributes to the ongoing effort to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying altered seed viability, germination and field emergence of low phytic acid crops, understanding of which is necessary in order to mitigate these problems. Overall design: The four genotypic lines used in this study are designated as “MRP,” contains four near isogenic lines, the lpa line “2mlpa” (mrp-l and mrp-n mutations) and three normal phytic acid lines, “2MWT” (no mutation), “2MWT-L” (mrp-n mutation only), and “2MWT-N” (mrp-l mutation only). These lines were developed from a cross between the lpa lines “CX-1834” (mrp-1 and mrp-n mutations) and the normal phytic acid line V99-5089. The mutations conferring the lpa trait in 2mlpa and CX-1834 are the result of point mutations in the epistatically interacting loci, MRP-L and MRP-N, on chromosomes 19 and 3, respectively (Wilcox et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2006; Maroof et al., 2009). In the associated manuscript, eight experimental lines were used – 1mlpa, 1MWT, 2mlpa, 2MWT, 2MWT-L, 2MWT-N, 3mlpa, and 3MWT. The eight experimental lines represent three distinct subsets of genotypes and data from four lines are included in this dataset. Other four lines have been released from our previous publication (data in GSE101692).

However, perturbations in phytic acid biosynthesis are associated with poor seed vigor. Since the benefits of the <i>lpa</i> trait, in terms of end-use quality and sustainability, far outweigh the negatives associated with poor seed performance, a fuller understanding of the molecular basis behind the negatives will assist crop breeders and engineers in producing variates with <i>lpa</i> and better germination rate. The gene regulatory network (GRN) for developing low and normal phytic acid soybean seeds was previously constructed, with genes modulating a variety of processes pertinent to phytic acid metabolism and seed viability being identified. In this study, a comparative time series analysis of low and normal phytic acid soybeans was carried out to investigate the transcriptional regulatory elements governing the transitional dynamics from dry seed to germinated seed. GRNs were reverse engineered from time series transcriptomic data of three distinct genotypic subsets composed of <i>lpa</i> soybean lines and their normal phytic acid sibling lines. Using a robust unsupervised network inference scheme, putative regulatory interactions were inferred for each subset of genotypes. These interactions were further validated by published regulatory interactions found in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and motif sequence analysis. Results indicate that <i>lpa</i> seeds have increased sensitivity to stress, which could be due to changes in phytic acid levels, disrupted inositol phosphate signaling, disrupted phosphate ion (Pi) homeostasis, and altered <i>myo</i>-inositol metabolism. Putative regulatory interactions were identified for the latter two processes. Changes in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling candidate transcription factors (TFs) putatively regulating genes in this process were identified as well. Analysis of the GRNs reveal altered regulation in processes that may be affecting the germination of <i>lpa</i> soybean seeds. Therefore, this work contributes to the ongoing effort to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying altered seed viability, germination and field emergence of <i>lpa</i> crops, understanding of which is necessary in order to mitigate these problems."

However, much remains unknown about the function of the CO gene family in soybean and the molecular mechanisms underlying short-day photoperiodic flowering of soybean. We identified 26 CO homologs (GmCOLs) in the soybean genome, many of them previously unreported. Phylogenic analysis classified GmCOLs into three clades conserved among flowering plants. Two homeologous pairs in Clade I, GmCOL1a/GmCOL1b and GmCOL2a/GmCOL2b, showed the highest sequence similarity to Arabidopsis CO. The mRNA abundance of GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b exhibited a strong diurnal rhythm under flowering-inductive short days and peaked at dawn, which coincided with the rise of GmFT5a expression. In contrast, the mRNA abundance of GmCOL2a and GmCOL2b was extremely low. Our transgenic study demonstrated that GmCOL1a, GmCOL1b, GmCOL2a and GmCOL2b fully complemented the late flowering effect of the co-1 mutant in Arabidopsis. Together, these results indicate that GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b are potential inducers of flowering in soybean. Our data also indicate rapid regulatory divergence between GmCOL1a/GmCOL1b and GmCOL2a/GmCOL2b but conservation of their protein function. Dynamic evolution of GmCOL regulatory mechanisms may underlie the evolution of photoperiodic signaling in soybean."

In plants, DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1) is the founding member of a highly conserved family of RNase III-like endonucleases that function as core machinery proteins to process hairpin-like precursor transcripts into mature miRNAs, small regulatory RNAs, 21-22 nucleotides in length. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) were used to generate single and double-mutants of putative soybean DCL1 homologs, DCL1a and DCL1b, to confirm their functional role(s) in the soybean miRNA pathway. Neither DCL1 single mutant, dcl1a or dcl1b plants, exhibited a pronounced morphological or molecular phenotype. However, the dcl1a/dcl1b double mutant expressed a strong morphological phenotype, characterized by reduced seed size and aborted seedling development, in addition to defective miRNA precursor transcript processing efficiency and deregulated miRNA target gene expression. Together, these findings indicate that the two soybean DCL1 paralogs, DCL1a and DCL1b, largely play functionally redundant roles in the miRNA pathway and are essential for normal plant development."

The development of root nodules is intricately regulated by endogenous and exogenous cues. The phytohormones brassinosteroids (BRs) have been shown to negatively regulate nodulation in soybean, but the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we performed transcriptomic analyses and revealed that BR signaling negatively regulates nodulation factor (NF) signaling. We found that BR signaling inhibits nodulation through its signaling component GmBES1-1&#xa0;by dampening NF signaling and nodule formation. In addition, GmBES1-1 can directly interact with both GmNSP1 and GmNSP2 to inhibit their interaction and the DNA-binding activity of GmNSP1. Furthermore, BR-induced nuclear accumulation of GmBES1-1 is essential for inhibiting nodulation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that regulation of GmBES1-1 subcellular localization by BRs plays a key role in the legume-rhizobium symbiosis and plant development, indicating a crosstalk mechanism between phytohormone and symbiosis signaling pathways."

However, the mechanism for aphid resistance in soybean is remain enigmatic, very little information is available about the different mechanisms between antibiosis and antixenosis genotypes. Here we dissected aphid infestation into three stages and used genome-wide gene expression profiling to investigate the underlying aphid-plant interaction mechanisms. Approximately 990 million raw reads in total were obtained, the high expression correlation in each genotype between infestation and non-infestation indicated that the response to aphid was controlled by a small subset of important genes. Moreover, plant response to aphid infestation was more rapid in resistant genotypes. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), a total of 901 transcription factor (TF) genes categorized to 40 families were identified with distinct expression patterns, of which AP2/ERF, MYB and WRKY families were proposed to playing dominated roles. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that these genes had either similar or distinct expression patterns in genotypes.

The results showed that 500 mg/L WSHM increased the adsorption and colonization of rhizobia in soybean roots. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and targeted metabolomics showed that WSHM could regulate the content and distribution of endogenous hormones in the roots, stems, and leaves of soybean plants at the initial stage of soybean nodulation. Transcriptomic analysis showed a total of 2406 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by the 25th day under test conditions, accounting for 4.89 % of total annotation genes (49159). These DEGs were found to contribute primarily to the MAPK signaling pathway, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and plant hormone signal transduction, according to the -log10 (Padjust) value in the KEGG pathway. Subsequently, DEGs related to these hormones were selected for verification using Quantity-PCR.

As the result, we detected a total of 27,639 alterations in gene expression during callus formation, which could be categorized into eight distinct clusters. Gene ontology analysis revealed that genes associated with hormones, cell wall modification, and cell cycle underwent transcriptional reprogramming throughout callus formation. Furthermore, by scrutinizing the expression patterns of genes related to hormones, cell cycle, cell wall, and transcription factors, we discovered that auxin, cytokinin, and brassinosteroid signaling pathways activate genes involved in both root and shoot meristem development during callus formation.

We determined that genes encoding enzymes in several metabolic pathways leading to the formation of hormones, such as gibberellic acid, and other metabolites are up-regulated in giant scarlet runner bean and common bean suspensors. Genes involved in transport and Golgi body organization are up-regulated within the suspensors of these plants as well, strengthening the view that giant specialized suspensors serve as a hormone factory and a conduit for transferring substances to the developing embryo proper. By contrast, genes controlling transcriptional regulation, development, and cell division are up-regulated primarily within the embryo proper. Transcriptomes from less specialized soybean and <i>Arabidopsis</i> suspensors demonstrated that fewer genes encoding metabolic enzymes and hormones are up-regulated. Genes active in the embryo proper, however, are functionally similar to those active in scarlet runner bean and common bean embryo proper regions. We uncovered a set of suspensor- and embryo proper-specific transcription factors (TFs) that are shared by all embryos irrespective of morphology, suggesting that they are involved in early differentiation processes common to all plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) experiments with scarlet runner bean and soybean WOX9, an up-regulated suspensor TF, gained entry into a regulatory network important for suspensor development irrespective of morphology."

Methods: Seeds were germinated in the presence or absence of 200 µM PBZ. Seeds were germinated in 28°C temperature and 12/12h photoperiod (dark/light) and harvested at 12, 24 and 36 hours after imbibition (HAI). Three biological replicates were performed. Results: Identification of GA-responsive genes during germination in Glycine max.

Although the GA effects on seed germination have been studied in a number of species, little is known about the transcriptional reprogramming modulated by GA during this phase in species other than Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we report the transcriptome analysis of soybean embryonic axes during germination in the presence of paclobutrazol (PBZ), a GA biosynthesis inhibitor. We found a number of differentially expressed cell wall metabolism genes, supporting their roles in cell expansion during germination. Several genes involved in the biosynthesis and signaling of other phytohormones were also modulated, indicating an intensive hormonal crosstalk at the embryonic axis. We have also found 26 photosynthesis genes that are up-regulated by PBZ at 24&#x2009;hours after imbibition (HAI) and down-regulated at 36 HAI, which led us to suggest that this is part of a strategy to implement an autotrophic growth program in the absence of GA-driven mobilization of reserves. Finally, 30 transcription factors (mostly from the MYB, bHLH, and bZIP families) were down-regulated by PBZ and are likely downstream GA targets that will drive transcriptional changes during germination."

Seed of cultivar is generally larger than wild soybean, therefore here we comprehensively analyzed transcriptomes of thirteen soybean accessions seeds including seven wild soybeans and six landraces through applying strand-specific RNA sequencing. Differential expressed genes related seed weight were identified, some of them were known to be associated with seed development in Arabidopsis. Noncoding RNAs are known to play important roles in plant development, and we profiled the expression pattern of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in cultivated and wild soybean seeds. We have identified 1,251 long intergenic noncoding RNA, 243 intronic RNA and 81 antisense lncRNA, transcriptional levels of a number of lncRNAs were significantly different between cultivated and wild soybeans, suggesting that lncRNA may be involved in soybean seed development.

We analyzed seed transcriptomes from thirteen soybean samples, including six landraces and seven wild accessions using strand-specific RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes related to seed weight were identified, and some of their homologs were associated with seed development in Arabidopsis. We also identified 1251 long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), 243 intronic RNAs and 81 antisense lncRNAs de novo from these soybean transcriptomes. We then profiled the expression patterns of lncRNAs in cultivated and wild soybean seeds, and found that transcript levels of a number of lncRNAs were sample-specific. Moreover, gene transcript and lincRNA co-expression network analysis showed that some soybean lincRNAs might have functional roles as they were hubs of co-expression modules. In conclusion, this study systematically explored potential genes and molecular pathways as candidates for differences in seed weight resulting from soybean domestication, and will provide a useful future resource for molecular breeding of soybeans."

Smar2C2 allows for the identification of upwards of 70 million unique transcription start sites from a single sample with as little as 40 pg of RNA input. Overall design: Examination of transcriptoinal start sites using a novel technique across several plant species,36030508,"The precise and accurate identification and quantification of transcriptional start sites (TSSs) is key to understanding the control of transcription. The core promoter consists of the TSS and proximal non-coding sequences, which are critical in transcriptional regulation. Therefore, the accurate identification of TSSs is important for understanding the molecular regulation of transcription. Existing protocols for TSS identification are challenging and expensive, leaving high-quality data available for a small subset of organisms. This sparsity of data impairs study of TSS usage across tissues or in an evolutionary context. To address these shortcomings, we developed Smart-Seq2 Rolling Circle to Concatemeric Consensus (Smar2C2), which identifies and quantifies TSSs and transcription termination sites. Smar2C2 incorporates unique molecular identifiers that allowed for the identification of as many as 70 million sites, with no known upper limit. We have also generated TSS data sets from as little as 40&#x2009;pg of total RNA, which was the smallest input tested. In this study, we used Smar2C2 to identify TSSs in Glycine max (soybean), Oryza sativa (rice), Sorghum bicolor (sorghum), Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Zea mays (maize) across multiple tissues. This wide panel of plant TSSs facilitated the identification of evolutionarily conserved features, such as novel patterns in the dinucleotides that compose the initiator element (Inr), that correlated with promoter expression levels across all species examined. We also discovered sequence variations in known promoter motifs that are positioned reliably close to the TSS, such as differences in the TATA box and in the Inr that may prove significant to our understanding and control of transcription initiation. Smar2C2 allows for the easy study of these critical sequences, providing a tool to facilitate discovery."

In plants they affect a wide variety of biological process like growth, development and response to biotic and abiotic stress. Glycine max is one of the most important crop worldwide due to its rich protein and oil content. Drought and salt stress are the main abiotic stresses that affect soybean. Salt stress impacts the fisiology of the plants due to the damage in the photosynthetic rate, growth and development. This work aim to identify salt-stress responsive miRNAs and their respective targets in Glycine max using high-throughput RNA sequencing technology. Overall design: Four mRNAseq libraries from soybean leaves. Each library consist in a pool of three different plants treated with 200mM of NaCl or control. The libraries were contructed in duplicates.",28257523,"Soybean, a crop known by its economic and nutritional importance, has been the subject of several studies that assess the impact and the effective plant responses to abiotic stresses. Salt stress is one of the main environmental stresses and negatively impacts crop growth and yield. In this work, the RNA editing process in the chloroplast of soybean plants was evaluated in response to a salt stress. Bioinformatics approach using sRNA and mRNA libraries were employed to detect specific sites showing differences in editing efficiency. RT-qPCR was used to measure editing efficiency at selected sites. We observed that transcripts of NDHA, NDHB, RPS14 and RPS16 genes presented differences in coverage and editing rates between control and salt-treated libraries. RT-qPCR assays demonstrated an increase in editing efficiency of selected genes. The salt stress enhanced the RNA editing process in transcripts, indicating responses to components of the electron transfer chain, photosystem and translation complexes. These increases can be a response to keep the homeostasis of chloroplast protein functions in response to salt stress."

Here, we investigated the functional role of soybean (Glycine max) BIR1 (GmBIR1) during soybean interaction with soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines) and the molecular mechanism through which GmBIR1 regulates plant immunity. Overexpression of wild-type variant of GmBIR1 (WT-GmBIR1) using transgenic soybean hairy roots significantly increased soybean susceptibility to SCN, whereas overexpression of kinase-dead variant (KD-GmBIR1) significantly increased plant resistance. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes oppositely regulated in WT-GmBIR1 and KD-GmBIR1 upon SCN infection were enriched primarily in defense and immunity-related functions. Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis identified 208 proteins as putative substrates of the GmBIR1 signaling pathway, 114 of which were differentially phosphorylated upon SCN infection. In addition, the phosphoproteomic data pointed to a role of the GmBIR1 signaling pathway in regulating alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Genome-wide analysis of splicing events provided compelling evidence supporting a role of the GmBIR1 signaling pathway in establishing alternative splicing during SCN infection. Our results provide novel mechanistic insights into the function of the GmBIR1 signaling pathway in regulating soybean transcriptome and spliceome via differential phosphorylation of splicing factors and regulation of splicing events of pre-mRNA decay- and spliceosome-related genes."

Transcripts representing 216 unique genes demonstrated a higher level of translational activity in at least one stage by exhibiting higher translational efficiencies (TEs) in which there were relatively more ribosome footprint sequence reads mapping to the transcript than were present in the control total RNA sample. The majority of these transcripts were more translationally active at the early stage of seed development and included 12 unique serine or cysteine proteases and 16 2S albumin and low molecular weight cysteine-rich proteins that may serve as substrates for turnover and mobilization early in seed development. It would appear that the serine proteases and 2S albumins play a vital role in the early stages. In contrast, our investigation of profiles of 19 genes encoding high abundance seed storage proteins, such as glycinins, beta-conglycinins, lectin, and Kunitz trypsin inhibitors, showed that they all had similar patterns in which the TE values started at low levels and increased approximately 2 to 6-fold during development. The highest levels of these seed protein transcripts were found at the mid-developmental stage, whereas the highest ribosome footprint levels of only up to 1.6 TE were found at the late developmental stage.

Comparison of the transcript profiles identified 3,543 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two genotypes, with 2,193 genes downregulated and 1,350 genes upregulated. The largest numbers of DEGs were identified at 55 DAF. The DEGs identified at 25 DAF represented a unique pattern of GO category distributions. KEGG pathway analyses identified 541 altered metabolic pathways in cgy-2-NIL. At 18DAF, 12 DEGs were involved in arginine and proline metabolism. The cgy-2 allele in the homozygous form modified the expression of several Cupin allergen genes. The cgy-2 allele is an alteration of a functional allele that is closely related to soybean protein amino acid quality, and is useful for hypoallergenic soybean breeding programs that aim to improve seed protein quality."

Results: RNAs were extracted from immature seed from an extended hilum region (i.e., the hilum and a small ring of tissue surrounding the hilum in which the cracks form) at three different developmental stages:10-25, 25-50 and 50-100 mg seed fresh weight in two independent replicates for each stage. The transcriptomes of these samples from both the Clark isoline containing the mi allele (PI 547628, UC413, ii R t mi G), and its recurrent Clark 63 parent isoline (PI 548532, UC7, ii R T Mi g), which was used for six generations of backcrossing, were compared for differential expression of 88,648 Glyma models of the soybean genome Wm82.a2. The RNA sequence data obtained from the 12 cDNA libraries were subjected to padj value &lt;0.05 and at least two-fold expression differences to select with confidence genes differentially expressed in the hilum-containing tissue of the seed coat between the two lines. Glyma.09G008400 annotated as encoding an ethylene forming enzyme, ACC oxidase (ACO), was found to be highly overexpressed in the mi hilum region at 165 RPKMs (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) compared to the standard line at just 0.03 RPKMs. Evidence of changes in expression of genes downstream of the ethylene pathway included those involved in auxin and gibberellin hormone action and extensive differences in expression of cell wall protein genes. These changes are postulated to determine the restricted hilum size and cracking phenotypes. Conclusions: We present transcriptome and phenotypic evidence that substantially higher expression of an ethylene-forming ACO gene likely shifts hormone balance and sets in motion downstream changes resulting in a smaller hilum phenotype and the cracks observed in the minute hilum (mi) isoline as compared to its recurrent parent.

Although ETI is often associated with the hypersensitive response (HR), various R genes mediate an HR-independent process known as extreme resistance (ER). In the soybean-Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) pathosystem, the strain-specific CI protein of SMV functions as an effector of Rsv3-mediated ER. In this study, we used the soybean (Rsv3)-SMV (CI) pathosystem to gain insight into the molecular signaling pathway involved in ER. We used genome-wide transcriptome analysis to identify a subset of the type 2C protein phophatase (PP2C) genes that are specifically up-regulated in Rsv3-mediated ER. Gain-of-function analysis of the most significantly expressed soybean PP2C gene, GmPP2C3a, showed that ABA-induced GmPP2C3a functions as a key regulator of Rsv3-mediated ER. Our results further suggest that the primary mechanism of ER against viruses is the inhibition of viral cell-to-cell movement by callose deposition in an ABA signaling-dependent manner."

PRJNA246058,Glycine max,Comprehensive characterization and RNA-Seq profiling of the HD-Zip transcription factor family in soybean (Glycine max) during dehydration and salt stress,"Background The homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-Zip) transcription factor family is one of the largest plant specific superfamilies, and includes genes with roles in modulation of plant growth and response to environmental stresses. Many HD-Zip genes are characterized in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and members of the family are being investigated for abiotic stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and cucumber (Cucmis sativus). Findings in these species suggest HD-Zip genes as high priority candidates for crop improvement. Results In this study we have identified members of the HD-Zip gene family in soybean cv. 'Williams 82', and characterized their expression under dehydration and salt stress. Homology searches with BLASTP and Hidden Markov Model guided sequence alignments identified 101 HD-Zip genes in the soybean genome. Phylogeny reconstruction coupled with domain and gene structure analyses using soybean, Arabidopsis, rice, grape (Vitis vinifera), and Medicago truncatula homologues enabled placement of these sequences into four previously described subfamilies. Of the 101 HD-Zip genes identified in soybean, 88 exist as whole-genome duplication-derived gene pairs, indicating high retention of these genes following polyploidy in Glycine ~10 Mya. The HD-Zip genes exhibit ubiquitous expression patterns across 24 conditions that include 17 tissues of soybean. An RNA-Seq experiment performed to study differential gene expression at 0, 1, 6 and 12 hr soybean roots under dehydration and salt stress identified 20 differentially expressed (DE) genes. Several of these DE genes are orthologs of genes previously reported to play a role under abiotic stress, implying conservation of HD-Zip gene functions across species. Screening of HD-Zip promoters identified transcription factor binding sites that are overrepresented in the DE genes under both dehydration and salt stress, providing further support for the role of HD-Zip genes in abiotic stress responses. Conclusions We provide a thorough description of soybean HD-Zip genes, and identify potential candidates with probable roles in dehydration and salt stress. Expression profiles generated for all soybean genes, under dehydration and salt stress, at four time points, will serve as an important resource for the soybean research community, and will aid in understanding plant responses to abiotic stress.

Here, we defined temporal transcript accumulation in developing roots from seven vascular plants, permitting a genome-wide comparative analysis of the molecular programs used by a single organ across diverse species. The resulting gene expression maps uncover significant similarity in the genes employed in roots and their developmental expression profiles. The detailed analysis of a subset of 133 genes known to be associated with root development in Arabidopsis thaliana indicates that most of these are used in all plant species. Strikingly, this was also true for root development in a lycophyte (Selaginella moellendorffii), which forms morphologically different roots and is thought to have evolved roots independently. Thus, despite vast differences in size and anatomy of roots from diverse plants, the basic molecular mechanisms employed during root formation appear to be conserved. This suggests that roots evolved in the two major vascular plant lineages either by parallel recruitment of largely the same developmental program or by elaboration of an existing root program in the common ancestor of vascular plants."

PRJNA140453,Glycine max,Epigenetic Regulation of the Transition from Seed Maturation to Germination in Soybean,"How epigenetics is involved in the transition from seed maturation to seed germination largely remains elusive. To uncover the possible role of epigenetics in gene expression during the transition from seed maturation to seed germination in soybean, the transcriptome of cotyledons from four stages of soybean seed maturation and germination, including mid-late maturation, late maturation, seed dormancy and seed germination, were profiled by Illumina sequencing. For the genes that are quantitatively regulated at the four stages, two antagonistic epigenetic marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, together with the binding of RNA polymerase II, were investigated at the four stages by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). For 10 out of 16 genes examined, the relative enrichment of histone modification marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) and RNA polymerase II binding on their promoter regions correlates well with their relative expression levels at four stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetics in transcriptional regulation. A striking finding is that seed germination-specific genes start to show open chromatin (H3K4me3) during late seed maturation although their transcripts do not accumulate, which is further supported by RNA polymerase II binding. Together, our results provide the first evidence that seed germination genes can be primed for transcription (open chromatin and RNA polymerase II binding) during seed maturation, highlighting that the transition from seed maturation to seed germination starts at late seed maturation stages at both the genetic and epigenetic levels. Overall design: Illumina sequencing of transcripts from cotyledons of mid-maturation (B1 stage) and late maturation (AA1 stage) seeds, whole dry seeds, and cotyledons of seedlings six days after imbibition.",29078418,"We profiled soybean and <i>Arabidopsis</i> methylomes from the globular stage through dormancy and germination to understand the role of methylation in seed formation. CHH methylation increases significantly during development throughout the entire seed, targets primarily transposable elements (TEs), is maintained during endoreduplication, and drops precipitously within the germinating seedling. By contrast, no significant global changes in CG- and CHG-context methylation occur during the same developmental period. An <i>Arabidopsis ddcc</i> mutant lacking CHH and CHG methylation does not affect seed development, germination, or major patterns of gene expression, implying that CHH and CHG methylation does not play a significant role in seed development or in regulating seed gene activity. By contrast, over 100 TEs are transcriptionally de-repressed in <i>ddcc</i> seeds, suggesting that the increase in CHH-context methylation may be a failsafe mechanism to reinforce transposon silencing. Many genes encoding important classes of seed proteins, such as storage proteins, oil biosynthesis enzymes, and transcription factors, reside in genomic regions devoid of methylation at any stage of seed development. Many other genes in these classes have similar methylation patterns, whether the genes are active or repressed. Our results suggest that methylation does not play a significant role in regulating large numbers of genes important for programming seed development in both soybean and <i>Arabidopsis.</i> We conclude that understanding the mechanisms controlling seed development will require determining how <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements and their cognate transcription factors are organized in genetic regulatory networks."

In addition, genes regulating the transmembrane transport of metal ions, phosphates, sulphates, peptides, and sugars were differentially modified. On the contrary, a loss of H3K4me3 marks was found in several key transcription factor genes and was correlated with the down-regulation of the defense-related network in nodules, which could contribute to nodule maintenance.

KEGG disclosed that 52% of the phenylpropanoid pathway related genes were up-regulated. The relative gene expression study for selected genes of that pathway was conducted by RT-qPCR using Rpp1-Rpp4 carrying lines with T1-2 infection. The RT-qPCR results revealed that the Rpp lines utilized these genes in a rate limiting manner as a defence response. With the exception of glycinol 4-dimethylallyltransferase (G4DT) and chalcone reductase (CHR), all the genes showed the greatest expression at 12 hai, but the gene expressions which occur between 24 and 96 hai make these Rpp lines unique to their respective ASR isolates. Moreover, functional coordination of arogenate dehydratase 6 (ADT6) and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate synthase (ispG), chalcone synthase (CHS) and CHR, and G4DT and phytyltransferase 3 (PT3) may have a great impact on soybean resistance against ASR."

PRJNA304631,Glycine max,Genome-wide transcriptome analyses of developing seeds from low and normal phytic acid soybean lines,"Purpose: Comprehensive comparison of gene-expression profiles between 3mlpa (mutant with low phytic acid) and 3MWT (non-mutant with normal phyic acid) soybean lines (Glycine max) at five stages of seed development using RNA-Seq approaches. Methods: mRNA sequencing reads (101SE) were generated in triplicate from five seed developmental stages of 3mlpa and 3MWT soybean line using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Results: A total of 4235 differentially expressed genes, including 512-transcription factor genes were identified. Eighteen biological processes such as apoptosis, glucan metabolism, cellular transport, photosynthesis and 9 transcription factor families including WRKY, CAMTA3 and SNF2 were enriched during seed development. Genes associated with apoptosis, glucan metabolism, and cellular transport showed enhanced expression in early stages of lpa seed development, while those associated with photosynthesis showed decreased expression in late developmental stages. Conclusion: This study provides a global perspective of transcriptomal changes during soybean seed development in 3mlpa mutant. The results suggest that low phtic acid-causing mutations in 3mlpa play a role in inducing and suppressing plant defense responses during early and late stages of seed development, respectively. Overall design: RNA-Seq of five seed developing soybean seeds from mips1/mrp-l/mrp-n triple mutant line (with low phytic acid) and MIPS1/MRP-L/MRP-N non-mutant line (with normal phytic acid).

The effects of weeds on the soybean transcriptome were evaluated in field conditions during four separate gR1.fastqing seasons. Methods: RNASeq data were collected from 6 biological samples of soybeans gR1.fastqing with or without weeds. Weed species and the methods to maintain weed free controls varied between years to mitigate treatment effects and to allow detection of general soybeans weed responses. Key results: Soybean plants were not visibly nutrient or water stressed. We identified 55 consistently down-regulated genes in weedy plots. Many of the down-regulated genes were heat shock genes. Fourteen genes were consistently up-regulated. Several transcription factors including a PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-like gene (PIF3) were included among the up-regulated genes.

RM55-rm is homozygous for a mutable allele (rm) that specifies black and brown striped seeds; RM30-R* is a stable black revertant isoline derived from the mutable line; and RM38-r has brown seed coats due to a recessive r allele shown to translate a truncated MYB protein. Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated RM55-rm line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated TgmR*) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the R locus, Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by R was expressed at only very low levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-R* line, it upregulated expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (ANS2, ANS3) to promote the synthesis of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-R* revertant also carried the 13 kb TgmR* insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13kb TgmR* element. As determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the TgmR* sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-R* than in the mutable RM55-rm progenitor line. The stabilized and more methylated RM30-R* revertant line apparently lacks effective binding of a transposae to its subterminal repeats, thus allowing intron splicing to proceed resulting in sufficient MYB protein to stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats. In this regard, the TgmR* element in soybean resembles McClintock’s Spm-suppressible and change-of-state alleles of maize. This comparison explains the opposite effects of the TgmR* element on intron splicing of the MYB gene in which it resides depending on the methylation state of the element. Overall design: Differential RNA expression of anthocyanin pathway genes in the seed coats of two seed color lines: RM30-R* (black) and RM38-r (brown).

The cis-elements of PHO (phosphatase) element, PHO-like element and P responsive element were present more frequently in promoter regions of up-regulated DEGs compared to that of randomly-selected genes in the soybean genome. Our transcriptomic data showed an intricate network containing transporters, transcription factors, kinases and phosphatases, hormone and calcium signaling components is involved in plant responses to early Pi deprivation."

Rps genes are race-specific, yet the mechanism of resistance, as well as susceptibility, remains largely unclear. Taking advantage of RNA-seq technology, we sequenced the transcriptomes of 10 near isogenic lines (NIL), each with a unique Rps gene, and the recurrent susceptible parent ‘Williams’. A total of 4330 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in ‘Williams’ while 2075 to 5499 DEGs were identified in each NIL. Comparisons between the NILs and ‘Williams’ allowed classification of two major groups of DEGs of interest: incompatible reaction associated genes (IRAGs) and compatible reaction associated genes (CRAGs). Hierarchical cluster analysis divided NILs into three clusters: Cluster I (Rps1-a), Cluster II (Rps1-b, 1-c and 1-k) and Cluster III (Rps3-a, 3-b, 3-c, 4, 5, and 6). Heatmap analysis, along with GO analysis suggested that the diversity of clusters for NILs were likely due to variation of the number of DEGs and the intensity of gene expression, rather than functional differentiation. Further analysis suggested that transcription factors might play pivotal role in determination of the cluster pattern, and that WRKY family were strongly associated with incompatible reactions. Analysis of IRAGs and CRAGs with putative functions suggested that the regulation of many phytohormone signaling pathways were associated with incompatible or compatible interactions with potential crosstalk between each other. As such, our study provides an in depth view of both incompatible and compatible interactions between soybean and P. sojae, which provides further insight into the mechanisms involved in host-pathogen interactions.

While research has advanced our understanding of plant responses to long-term nutrient deficiencies, less is known about the signaling pathways and immediate responses to certain nutrient deficiencies, such as Pi and Fe deficiencies.

Here, we mimicked nutrient deficiency-induced sucrose signaling by adding sucrose directly to the roots.

Here, we present a genome-wide survey of the selection of MIRs and miRNA targets during soybean domestication and improvement. Our results suggest that, overall, MIRs have higher evolutionary rates than miRNA targets. Nonetheless, they do demonstrate certain similar evolutionary patterns during soybean domestication: MIRs and miRNA targets with high expression and duplication status, and with greater numbers of partners, exhibit lower nucleotide divergence than their counterparts without these characteristics, suggesting that expression level, duplication status, and miRNA-target interaction are essential for evolution of MIRs and miRNA targets. Further investigation revealed that miRNA-target pairs that are subjected to strong purifying selection have greater similarities than those that exhibited genetic diversity. Moreover, mediated by domestication and improvement, the similarities of a large number of miRNA-target pairs in cultivated soybean populations were increased compared to those in wild soybeans, whereas a small number of miRNA-target pairs exhibited decreased similarity, which may be associated with the adoption of particular domestication traits. Taken together, our results shed light on the co-evolution of MIRs and miRNA targets during soybean domestication."

Here we reported that an Alfin1-like soybean protein, GmPHD6, read H3K4me0/1/2 but not H3K4me3 with the N-terminal instead of the PHD finger. GmPHD6 does not possess transcriptional regulatory ability. Through the PHD finger, GmPHD6 interacts with its co-activator, LHP1-1/2. Using a transgenic hairy root system, we demonstrated that over-expression of GmPHD6 improved stress tolerance in transgenic soybean composites. Perhaps due to the excessive amount of LHP1 compared to that of GmPHD6, over-expression of LHP1-1/2 failed to do so. The integrity of the complex is essential in stress response, for the abrogation of DNA binding activity of GmPHD6 or the decrease of LHP1 content leads to stress sensitivity in soybean. GmPHD6 influences expression of dozens of stress-related genes to confer stress tolerance.

Soybean (Glycine max) is especially ozone sensitive, and research into its response to oxidative stress is limited. To better understand the genetic response in soybean to oxidative stress, an RNA-seq analysis of two soybean cultivars was performed comparing an ozone intolerant cultivar and an ozone resistant cultivar after being exposed to ozone. A cursory analysis of the transcriptome data revealed differences between cultivars in the expression levels of genes previously implicated in oxidative stress responses, indicating unique cultivar-specific responses. An examination of the timing of gene responses over the course of ozone exposure showed expression of cuticle wax genes in the intolerant line over all sampled time points, whereas the tolerant line only expressed this pathway in the first time point. The ozone tolerant cultivar has a thicker leaf structure and we believe this lends a passive benefit to the plant which the intolerant cultivar is attempting to supplement via cuticle wax synthesis. These results suggest that differences in genetic responses work in concert with physiological differences to explain differences in ozone tolerance between soybean cultivars.

Three dominant BSR resistance loci have been identified: Rbs1, Rbs2, and Rbs3. All three genes have been mapped to large, overlapping regions on soybean chromosome 16 though the gene networks regulating resistance remain unknown. Further, identifying resistant germplasm by genotyping or phenotyping remains difficult due to complexities of soybean/P. gregata interactions. To aid in identifying and characterizing soybean resistance genes, novel approaches bridging the gap between breeding and genomics are needed. To identify genes and gene networks important in the resistant response, I conducted RNA-Seq of leaf, stem, and root tissues collected 12, 24, and 36 hours after P. gregata or mock-infection of a Rbs3 resistant soybean genotype. I identified genes differentially expressed in response to infection (treatment) at each time point.",,
PRJNA1054397,Zhejiang University,The acyl acyl carrier protein thioesterases GmFATA1 and GmFATA2 are essential for fatty acid accumulation and growth in soybean,"Acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) thioesterases (FAT) hydrolyze acyl-ACP complexes to release FA in plastids, which ultimately affects FA biosynthesis and profiles. Soybean GmFATA1 and GmFATA2 are homoeologous genes encoding oleoyl-ACP thioesterases whose role in seed oil accumulation and plant growth has not been defined. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing mutation of Gmfata1 or 2 led to reduced leaf FA content and growth defect at the early seedling stage. In contrast, no homozygous double mutants were obtained. Combined this indicates that GmFATA1 and GmFATA2 display overlapping, but not complete functional redundancy. Combined transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis revealed a large number of genes involving in FA synthesis and FA chain elongation are expressed at reduced level in the Gmfata1 mutant, accompanied by a lower triacylglycerol abundance at the early seedling stage. Further analysis showed that the Gmfata1 or 2 mutants had increased composition of the beneficial FA, oleic acid. The growth defect of Gmfata1 could be at least partially attributed to reduced Acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, reduced abundance of five unsaturated monogalactosyldiacylglycerol lipids, and altered chloroplast morphology. On the other hand, overexpression of GmFATA in soybean led to significant increases of leaf FA content by 5.7%, vegetative growth and seed yield by 26.9%, and seed FA content by 23.2%. Thus, overexpression of GmFATA is an effective strategy to enhance soybean oil content and yield.",,

Other than mature RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), high throughput nascent RNA assays have been established and applied to provide details of transcription. We present here the first profiling of nascent RNA from trifoliate leaf and shoot apex of soybean. In combination of nascent RNA (chromatin bond RNA, CB RNA) and RNA-seq, we found that introns are largely spliced co-transcriptionally. Although alternative splicing (AS) is mainly determined at nascent RNA biogenesis, differential AS between tissues at mature RNA does not correlate well with co-transcriptional differential AS. Overall, RNA abundance is moderately correlated between nascent RNA and mature RNA in one tissue, but their fold changes between tissues is highly correlated at nascent RNA and mature RNA level. Thousands of novel transcripts (mainly noncoding RNA) were detected by CB RNA-seq, including two natural antisense RNA overlapped with two important genes controlling soybean reproductive development, FT2a and Dt1a. Taken together, we demonstrated the adoption of CB RNA-seq in soybean, which may shed light on gene expression regulation on important agronomic traits in leguminous crops.",,

However, their origin and evolutionary process associated to cold responsiveness are still lacking. By integrating multi-omics data of genomes, transcriptomes, and CBFs/DREB1s genome-wide binding profiles, we unveil the origin and evolution of CBFs/DREB1s and their regulatory network. Gene collinearity and phylogeny analyses show that CBF/DREB1 is an innovation evolved from tandem duplication-derived DREB III gene. A subsequent event of &#x3b5;-whole genome duplication led to two CBF/DREB1 archetypes (Clades I and II) in ancient angiosperms. In contrast to cold-insensitivity of Clade I and their parent DREB III genes, Clade II evolved a further innovation in cold-sensitive response and was stepwise expanded in eudicots and monocots by independent duplications. In geological time, the duplication events were mainly enriched around the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary and/or in the Late Cenozoic Ice Age, when the global average temperature significantly decreased. Consequently, the duplicated CBF/DREB1 genes contributed to the rewiring of CBFs/DREB1s-regulatory network for cold tolerance. Altogether, our results highlight an origin and convergent evolution of CBFs/DREB1s and their regulatory network probably for angiosperms adaptation to global cooling."

Global warming and climate change are driving an alarming increase in the frequency and intensity of combined drought and heat stress episodes, critically threatening global food security. Because high temperature is detrimental to reproductive processes, essential for plant yield, we measured the inner temperature, transpiration, sepal stomatal aperture, hormone concentrations and transcriptomic response of closed soybean flowers developing on plants subjected to a combination of drought and heat stress. Here, we report that, during a combination of drought and heat stress, soybean plants prioritize transpiration through flowers over transpiration through leaves by opening their flower stomata, while keeping their leaf stomata closed. This acclimation strategy, termed 'differential transpiration', lowers flower inner temperature by about 2-3&#xb0;C, protecting reproductive processes at the expense of vegetative tissues.

In this study, we focused on NAC and YABBY transcription factors which showed a conspicuous expression pattern during soybean seedling development. Their expression gradually increases from stage 1 to stage 4 of soybean germinating cotyledons. The highest level of expression was found at stage 4.

To define the developmental shifts in gene expression and begin to understand the gene regulatory networks that set this transition in motion, we carried out high-throughput RNA sequencing of cotyledons from seven developmental stages of soybean seedlings. We identified 154 gene models with high expression exclusively in the early seedling stages. A significant number (about 25&#xa0;%) of those genes with known annotations were involved in carbohydrate metabolism. A detailed examination of glyoxylate cycle genes revealed the upregulation of their expression in the early stages of development.

Profiling of DNA methylation in different organs revealed 2162 differentially methylated regions among organs, and a portion of hypomethylated regions were correlated with high expression of neighboring genes. Because of the different distribution of class I TEs (retrotransposons) and class II TEs (DNA transposons), the promoters of the lowest-expressed genes showed higher levels of CG and CHG methylation but a lower level of CHH methylation. We further found that the CHH methylation level of class II TEs was higher than class I TEs, possibly due to the presence of more smRNAs in class II TEs. In cotyledons of developing seeds, smRNA abundance was roughly positively correlated with hypermethylated regions but negatively related to hypomethylated regions.

BSR symptoms are often confused with other soybean diseases or nutrient stress, making it difficult to characterize and deploy resistance in soybean breeding programs. Different genetic studies have suggest BSR resistance could be controlled by a single gene or as many as three tightly linked genes, all located on the same interval of chromosome 16. This interval contains 107 receptor-like proteins (RLPs), similar to disease resistance genes characterized from other species. The RLPs are arranged in distinct clusters, each with different sequence signature. To gain insight into BSR resistance mechanisms, we took advantage of virus induced gene silencing, which allowed us to turn off different RLP clusters or cluster combinations. If a cluster was required for resistance, turning it off would result in resistant plants that became susceptible to BSR. Using this approach we identified two clusters that are required for resistance to BSR in a line carrying the Rbs1 resistance gene. Using whole genome expression analyses, we developed a network of genes regulated by the two clusters of RLPs to confer resistance.",,

Results showed that leaves presented more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than roots. Embrapa 48 responded to water deficit faster than BR 16, presenting a greater number of DEGs since the first signs of drought. Additionally, drought-tolerant genotype exhibited initial modulation of genes associated with stress, mainly belonging to the category of dehydration responsive genes. Finally, this study identified genes of the AP2/EREBP and WRKY families related to drought tolerance.",,

Although several MTI responses can be measured in different plant species, their magnitude is likely plant-species specific and even cultivar specific. In this work, we show that the variation in gene expression, either under untreated or treated conditions, is inherited. In addition, genes with potential additive and non-additive effects were identified in two mapping lines, several of these with a potential function in the control of the innate immunity. Likewise, we observed that some genes differentially expressed across the parental and mapping lines showed different DNA methylation patterns. Finally, a gene regulatory module analysis identified key networks that likely control soybean innate immunity. The data presented represent the basis for further functional analysis that can lead to a better understanding of the soybean innate immunity response.

Small RNA sequencing of dissected regions of immature seed coats demonstrated that CHS siRNA levels cause the patterns produced by the i-i and i-k alleles of the I locus, which restrict pigment to the hilum or saddle region of the seed coat, respectively. To identify the K1 locus, we compared RNA-Seq data from dissected regions of two Clark isolines having similar saddle phenotypes mediated by CHS siRNAs but different genotypes (homozygous i-k K1 versus homozygous i-i k1).

Studies have found that pod set can be as low as 20-40% under normal conditions. Generally, it is assumed that abortion rates can vary based on location in the canopy, source-sink relationship, hormone levels, shade, water status. However, the genetic controls of flower and pod abscission in soybean are largely unknown, and the effects of ozone on flower and pod abscission have not been thoroughly investigated.

This symbiosis establishment generally relies on rhizobium-produced Nod factors (NFs) and their perception by leguminous receptors (NFRs) that trigger nodulation. However, certain rhizobia hijack leguminous nodulation signalling via their type III secretion system, which functions in pathogenic bacteria to deliver effector proteins into host cells. Here, we report that rhizobia use pathogenic-like effectors to hijack legume nodulation signalling. The rhizobial effector Bel2-5 resembles the XopD effector of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris and could induce nitrogen-fixing nodules on soybean nfr mutant. The soybean root transcriptome revealed that Bel2-5 induces expression of cytokinin-related genes, which are important for nodule organogenesis and represses ethylene- and defense-related genes that are deleterious to nodulation. Remarkably, Bel2-5 introduction into a strain unable to nodulate soybean mutant affected in NF perception conferred nodulation ability. Our findings show that rhizobia employ and have customized pathogenic effectors to promote leguminous nodulation signalling."

Immunoblot analysis indicated that an adequate amount of protein was present for immunoprecipitation. To study rhizobial-induced transcriptional changes in the cortex during early nodule development, we identified a soybean promoter (Glyma.18g53890, Figure 1B) expressed exclusively in the cortex cells using LCM (Kerk et al., 2003; Casson et al., 2008) followed by transcriptional analysis. The cortex-specific promoter was used to drive the expression of GmRPL18 in soybean hairy roots. To capture events occurring in the cortex during the early stages of infection and initial cortical cell divisions, we inoculated plants and performed a time-course collection of root samples at 72- and 96-hour post inoculation (hpi) followed by TRAP-seq.

Taken together, time-course cortex-specific TRAP-seq was established for studying of early nodule development in soybean.

Genome-wide transcriptome, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses have been used previously to define the functional role of various plant genes in the nodulation process. However, while significant progress has been made, most of these studies have suffered from tissue dilution since only a few cells/root regions respond to rhizobial infection, with much of the root non-responsive. To partially overcome this issue, we adopted translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) to specifically monitor the response of the root cortex to rhizobial inoculation using a cortex-specific promoter. While previous studies have largely focused on the plant response within the root epidermis (e.g., root hairs) or within developing nodules, much less is known about the early responses within the root cortex, such as in relation to the development of the nodule primordium or growth of the infection thread. We focused on identifying genes specifically regulated during early nodule organogenesis using roots inoculated with <i>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</i>. A number of novel nodulation gene candidates were discovered, as well as soybean orthologs of nodulation genes previously reported in other legumes. The differential cortex expression of several genes was confirmed using a promoter-GUS analysis, and RNAi was used to investigate gene function. Notably, a number of differentially regulated genes involved in phytohormone signaling, including auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellic acid (GA), were also discovered, providing deep insight into phytohormone signaling during early nodule development."

The transcriptome analysis show numerous changes result from suppressing storage proteins but compensating proteins are accumulated without parallel changes in the protein's transcription. Overall design: Total RNA samples prepared from midmaturation wildtype and storage protein RNAi (SP-) soybeans were used to produce cDNA that was subjected to Illumina sequencing. The resulting sequences were assembled and analyzed to characterize the changes in transcriptome that results from suppressing storage protein synthesis/accumulation.",21398260,"The ontogeny of seed structure and the accumulation of seed storage substances is the result of a determinant genetic program. Using RNA interference, the synthesis of soybean (Glycine max) glycinin and conglycinin storage proteins has been suppressed. The storage protein knockdown (SP-) seeds are overtly identical to the wild type, maturing to similar size and weight, and in developmental ontogeny. The SP- seeds rebalance the proteome, maintaining wild-type levels of protein and storage triglycerides. The SP- soybeans were evaluated with systems biology techniques of proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics using both microarray and next-generation sequencing transcript sequencing (RNA-Seq). Proteomic analysis shows that rebalancing of protein content largely results from the selective increase in the accumulation of only a few proteins. The rebalancing of protein composition occurs with small alterations to the seed's transcriptome and metabolome. The selectivity of the rebalancing was further tested by introgressing into the SP- line a green fluorescent protein (GFP) glycinin allele mimic and quantifying the resulting accumulation of GFP. The GFP accumulation was similar to the parental GFP-expressing line, showing that the GFP glycinin gene mimic does not participate in proteome rebalancing. The results show that soybeans make large adjustments to the proteome during seed filling and compensate for the shortage of major proteins with the increased selective accumulation of other proteins that maintains a normal protein content."

However, very little information is available on the adaptive mechanisms, particularly in the important legume crop soybean (Glycine Max L.), which enable leaves to respond to high-Mn availability. Thus, to elucidate these mechanisms in soybean leaves at molecular level, we used an RNA sequencing approach to investigate transcriptomes of the leaves under Mn-sufficient and Pi-excessive conditions. Our investigation revealed that more genes showed altered expression patterns in old leaf than in young leaf under Mn excess, suggesting that the Mn excess-more-sensitive old leaf required expression change in a larger number of genes to cope with high-Mn stress than the Mn excess-less-sensitive young leaf. The functional classification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was examined to gain an understanding of how leaves respond to Mn stress, caused by soil Mn excess. As a result, more DEGs involved in nodulation, detoxification, nutrient/ion transport, transcriptional factors, key metabolic pathways, Mn remobilization and signalling were found in Mn-excessive induced old leaves than in Mn-excessive induced young leaves. Our findings have enabled the identification of molecular processes that play important roles in the acclimation of leaves to Mn excess, ultimately leading to the development of Mn-efficient soybean suitable for Mn-excessive soils. Overall design: The experiment was started at the onset of the fifth leaf stage when the plants were transferred to solutions with either normal (5 μM) or high (100 μM) Mn (added as MnSO4).

Three families of rhizobial tRFs were confirmed to regulate host genes associated with nodule initiation and development through hijacking the host RNA-interference machinery that involves ARGONAUTE 1. Silencing individual tRFs with the use of short tandem target mimics or by overexpressing their targets represses root hair curling and nodule formation, whereas repressing these targets with artificial microRNAs identical to the respective tRFs or mutating these targets with CRISPR-Cas9 promotes nodulation. Our findings thus uncover a bacterial small RNA-mediated mechanism for prokaryote-eukaryote interaction and may pave the way for enhancing nodulation efficiency in legumes."

Overall design: Key genes responsible for weedy and cultivar growth types in the soybean plants.,35281824,"In cultivated plants, shoot morphology is an important factor that influences crop economic value. However, the effects of gene expression patterns on shoot morphology are not clearly understood. In this study, the molecular mechanism behind shoot morphology (including leaf, stem, and node) was analyzed using RNA sequencing to compare weedy (creeper) and cultivar (stand) growth types obtained in F<sub>7</sub> derived from a cross of wild and cultivated soybeans. A total of 12,513 (in leaves), 14,255 (in stems), and 11,850 (in nodes) differentially expressed genes were identified among weedy and cultivar soybeans. Comparative transcriptome and expression analyses revealed 22 phytohormone-responsive genes. We found that <i>GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE 8</i> (<i>GA2ox</i>), <i>SPINDLY</i> (<i>SPY</i>), <i>FERONIA</i> (<i>FER</i>), <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), <i>CYTOKININ DEHYDROGENASE-1</i> (<i>CKX1</i>), and <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE-3</i> (<i>AHK3</i>), which are crucial phytohormone response genes, were mainly regulated in the shoot of weedy and cultivar types. These results indicate that interactions between phytohormone signaling genes regulate shoot morphology in weedy and cultivar growth type plants. Our study provides insights that are useful for breeding and improving crops to generate high-yield soybean varieties."

There are two major components of this disease: (i) root necrosis and (ii) foliar SDS. Root symptoms consist of root necrosis with vascular discoloration that extends upto several nodes and internodes into the stem. Foliar SDS symptom is characterized by interveinal chlorosis and necrosis in leaves which finally curl and fall off, and in severe cases by flower, pod abscission and immature seed formation. A major toxin involved in initiating foliar SDS has been identified. Nothing is known about how root necrosis develops. In order to unravel the mechanisms used by the pathogen to cause root necrosis, the transcriptome of the pathogen in infected soybean root tissues of a susceptible cultivar (Williams 82) was investigated. The transcriptomes of the germinating conidia and mycelia were also examined. Of the 14,845 predicted F. virguliforme genes, we observed that 12,017 (81%) were expressed in germinating conidial spores and 12,208 (82%) in mycelia and 10,626 (72%) in infected soybean roots. Of the 10,626 genes induced in infected roots, 224 were transcribed only following infection. Expression of several infection-induced genes encoding enzymes with oxidation-reduction properties suggests that degradation of antimicrobial compounds such as the phytoalexin, glyceollin could be important in establishing the biotrophic phase. Enzymes with hydrolytic and catalytic activities could play an important role in the transitioning of the pathogen from biotrophic to necrotrophic phase. Expression of a large number of genes encoding enzymes with catalytic and hydrolytic activities during late infection stage suggests cell wall degradation by some of these enzymes could be involved in root necrosis and establishing the necrotrophic phase in this pathogen. Overall design: RNA-seq data for Fusarium virguliforme Mont-1 germinating conidial spores, mycelia and soybean root tissue 3 and 5 days or 10 and 24 days post water incubation or infection with Fusarium virguliforme Mont-1 conidial spores.

Previous studies have identified certain WRKY transcription factors, which confer Cd tolerance in different plant species. In the present study, we have identified 29 Cd-responsive WRKY genes in Edamame [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and confirmed that 26 of those GmWRKY genes were up-regulated, while 3 were down-regulated. We have also cloned the novel, positively regulated GmWRKY142 gene from soybean and investigated its regulatory mechanism in Cd tolerance. GmWRKY142 was highly expressed in the root, drastically up-regulated by Cd, localized in the nucleus, and displayed transcriptional activity. The overexpression of GmWRKY142 in Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean hairy roots significantly enhanced Cd tolerance and lead to extensive transcriptional reprogramming of stress-responsive genes. ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 encoding cadmium tolerance 1 were induced in overexpression lines. Further analysis showed that GmWRKY142 activated the transcription of ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 by directly binding to the W-box element in their promoters. In addition, the functions of GmCDT1-1 and GmCDT1-2, responsible for decreasing Cd uptake, were validated by heterologous expression in A. thaliana. Our combined results have determined GmWRKYs to be newly discovered participants in response to Cd stress, and have confirmed that GmWRKY142 directly targets ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 to decrease Cd uptake and positively regulate Cd tolerance. The GmWRKY142-GmCDT1-1/2 cascade module provides a potential strategy to lower Cd accumulation in Edamame.",,

Its possible function in plants is less clear. In the present study, we tested the effect of melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) on soybean growth and development. Both spraying of leaves and seed-coating with melatonin significantly promoted soybean growth as judged from leaf size and plant height. This enhancement was also observed in soybean production and their fatty acid content. Melatonin increased pod number, seed number and seed weight. However, the 100-seed weight was not influenced by melatonin application. Melatonin also improved soybean tolerance to salt and drought stresses. Transcriptome analysis revealed that melatonin up-regulated the expression of many genes and alleviated the inhibitory effects of salt stress on gene expressions. Further detailed analysis of the affected pathways documents that melatonin likely achieved its promotional roles in soybean through enhancement of genes involved in cell division, photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and ascorbate metabolism. Our results demonstrate that melatonin has significant potential for improving of soybean growth and seed production. Further study should uncover more about the molecular mechanisms of melatonin’s function in soybeans and other crops. Overall design: Four different treatments were chosen, water, salt, 100µM melatonin and salt plus 100µM melatonin.

We compare the expression of the genes that participate in root hair development between Arabidopsis and other vascular plants to assess the conservation/diversification of the root hair development programs in vascular plants. Methods: We used RNA-Seq, in triplicates, to measure the genome-wide transcription activity of the root-hair cells isolated by Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) in Arabidopsis (COBL9::GFP transgeneic line, AtRH) and rice (EXPA30::GFP transgenic line, OsRH). We also generated RNA-Seq data, in triplicates, on the Arabidopsis rhd6 WER::GFP and WT WER::GFP by FACS to identify the RHD6-regulating root hair morphogenesis genes (AtRHM). For Arabidopsis, rice, tomato, soybean, cucumber and maize, we used RNA-seq, in triplicates, to measure genome-wide transcription activity of root hair cells filtered by sieves after stirred in liquid nitrogen (HAIR genes). Each sample was trimmed to retain high-quality reads, mapped to the reference genome by TopHat, and quantified by Cufflinks. The number of raw reads of Arabidopsis rhd6 WER::GFP and WT WER::GFP sample was counted by HTSeq and analyzed by edgeR to identify the differentially expressed genes. Results: We defined the root-hair transcriptome in diverse vascular plant species and analyzed the relative conservation/divergence in the expression of a large set of gene families. Overall design: RNA-Seq on the FACS isolated root hair-cells of Arabidopsis COBL9::GFP and rice EXPA30::GFP transgenic lines to get the gene expression of the root-hair cells of Arabidopsis and rice.

To understand the extent to which this program might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of root hair development genes from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylogenetics and transcriptomics, we discovered conservation of a core set of root hair genes across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient program for unidirectional cell growth coopted for root hair development during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of root hair development genes, relative to other root hair- and root-expressed genes, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of genes and gene functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of genes used for root hair patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of gene expression in a single plant cell type across multiple species."

Recently, the variation of DNA methylation has been described between wild type and DNA methylation-related mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the elaborate representation of soybean DNA methylomes remains lacking. Here, we described the epigenome maps of soybean root, stem, leaf, and cotyledon of developing seed at a single-base resolution. We confirmed the transcription start sites of genes using high-throughput sequencing and reported the DNA methylation patterns in gene and transposon regions. The correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation was revealed through transcriptome sequencing. We found CHH methylation may function in promotion of gene expression and ten cotyledon-preferred genes were identified CHH hypermethylated in cotyledon. Small RNA library sequencing showed that DNA methylation was enhanced by small RNAs not by strand-specific way, and the variation of DNA methylation between the organs was highly related with expression of small RNAs.

Here, we identified the transcription start sites of genes using high-throughput sequencing and then analyzed the DNA methylation status in soybean roots, stems, leaves, and cotyledons of developing seeds at single-base resolution. Profiling of DNA methylation in different organs revealed 2162 differentially methylated regions among organs, and a portion of hypomethylated regions were correlated with high expression of neighboring genes. Because of the different distribution of class I TEs (retrotransposons) and class II TEs (DNA transposons), the promoters of the lowest-expressed genes showed higher levels of CG and CHG methylation but a lower level of CHH methylation. We further found that the CHH methylation level of class II TEs was higher than class I TEs, possibly due to the presence of more smRNAs in class II TEs. In cotyledons of developing seeds, smRNA abundance was roughly positively correlated with hypermethylated regions but negatively related to hypomethylated regions. These studies provide significant insights into the complicated interplays among DNA methylation, smRNA abundance, TE distribution, and gene expression in soybean."

The results showed that both Mg application and AM fungal inoculation were beneficial to promote soybean growth under low P condition. And there was a synergistic effect between the Mg concentration and the P concentration in the root of HN112 under the inoculation condition. RNA-seq sequencing was carried out using the roots of P-efficient soybean HN89 under different Mg and inoculation treatments with low P condition, and the difference of gene expression profiles was analyzed between high and low Mg treatments, and different inoculation treatments. According to the analysis of GO function classification and KEGG enrichment, under high Mg condition, the metabolic pathway was mainly enriched in lipid metabolism and glucose metabolism pathway under the inoculation treatment compared with the non-inoculation treatment, which regulated carbon metabolism pathway. Under the low Mg condition, the metabolic pathway was mainly enriched in the photosynthesis- antenna protein pathway to regulate the photosynthesis pathway under the inoculation treatment compared with the non-inoculation treatment. At the same time, the inoculation treatment significantly increased soybean root starch concentration under low Mg condition, compared with the non-inoculation treatment, suggesting that the significant up-regulation of a large number of photosynthesis related genes might be related to the significant increase of starch concentration at this treatment. Overall design: we employed pot experiment and RNA-seq sequencing technology to investigate the effects of Mg nutrition on plant growth, P and Mg contents, and root transcriptomes in soybean plants inoculated with AM fungi, every treatment had three replicates.",,

Knock-down of one of the identified DEGs, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), diminished the LSHR and enhanced viral accumulation, suggesting the essential role of eIF5A in the G7-induced, Rsv1-mediated LSHR signalling pathway. This work provides an in-depth genome-wide analysis of high-throughput sequencing data, and identifies multiple genes and microRNA signatures that are associated with the Rsv1-mediated LSHR."
PRJNA635458,Institute of Crop Science,"GmNMHC5, A Neoteric Positive Transcription Factor of Flowering and Maturity in Soybean","Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is an important oil and food crop. Its growth and development is regulated by complex genetic networks, and there are still many genes with unknown functions in the regulation pathway. In this project, GmNMHC5, a member of the MADS-box protein family, was found to promote flowering and maturity in soybean. Gene expression profiling in transgenic plants confirmed that the 35S:GmNMHC5 T3 generation had early flowering and precocity. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of GmNMHC5, we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to explore differential gene expression in response to over-expression of GmNMHC5. For the transcriptome analysis, two biological replicates of transgenic mutants were analyzed. We used wild-type Jack as the control group, and 35S:GmNMHC5#25 and 35S:GmNMHC5-#32 as the experimental groups. The materials were grown in a controlled culture room at 28 degree under LD conditions, and leaf samples were taken at 31 DAE.

However, the distinct role of DNA methylation in establishing resistant and susceptible responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we developed and used a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) to characterize DNA methylome landscapes of soybean roots during the susceptible and resistant interactions with soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines). We also compared the methylomes of the NILs and their parents to identify introduced and stably inherited methylation variants. The genomes of the NILs were substantially differentially methylated under uninfected conditions. This difference was associated with differential gene expression that may prime the NIL responses to SCN infection. In response to SCN infection, the susceptible line exhibited reduced global methylation levels in both protein-coding genes and transposable elements, whereas the resistant line showed the opposite response, increased global methylation levels. Heritable and novel nonparental differentially methylated regions overlapping with genes associated with soybean response to SCN infection were identified and validated using transgenic hairy root system. Our analyses indicate that DNA methylation patterns associated with the susceptible and resistant interactions are highly specific and that novel and stably inherited methylation variants are of biological significance."

Several management practices are implemented to mitigate yield losses caused by SCN, including using SDHI (succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors) fungicides delivered as seed treatments. A set of studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of two seed-applied succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHI) compounds, fluopyram and pydiflumetofen, on SCN population densities, plant injury, and plant growth. Cyst counts in untreated control and pydiflumetofen treated plants were 3.44 and 3.59 times higher than fluopyram, respectively, while egg counts were 8.25 and 7.06 times higher in control and pydiflumetofen. Next-generation sequencing was later employed to identify transcriptomic shifts in gene expression profiles in fluopyram and pydiflumetofen -treated seedlings. RNA expression patterns of seed treatments clustered by sampling time (5 DAP vs. 10 DAP); therefore, downstream analysis was conducted by timepoint. At 5 DAP, 10,870 and 325 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified in fluopyram and pydiflumetofen, respectively. These same treatments generated 219 and 2 DEGs at 10 DAP. Multiple DEGs identified in soybean seedlings treated with fluopyram are linked to systemic resistance, suggesting a potential role of systemic resistance in the suppression of SCN by fluopyram, in addition to the known nematicidal activity. The non-target inhibition of soybean succinate dehydrogenase genes by fluopyram may be the origin of the phytotoxicity symptoms observed and potentially the source of the systemic resistance activation reported in the current study. This work helps to elucidate the mechanisms of suppression of SCN by fluopyram.",,

PRJNA165677,Glycine max,Methylation Changes in Soybean Early Maturation Seed Parts,"Seeds are comprised of three majors parts of distinct parental origin: the seed coat, embryo, and endosperm. The maternally-derived seed coat is important for nurturing and protecting the seeds during development. By contrast, the embryo and the endosperm are derived from a double fertilization event, where one sperm fertilizes the egg to form the diploid zygote and the other sperm fertilizes the central cell to form the triploid endosperm. Each seed parts undergo distinct developmental programs during seed development. What methylation changes occurring in the different seed parts, if any, remains unknown. To uncover the possible role of DNA methylation in different parts of the seed, we characterized the methylome of three major parts of an early maturation stage seed: seed coat, embryonic cotyledons, and embryonic axis using Illumina sequencing. Overall design: Illumina sequencing of bisulfite-converted genomic DNA, transcripts, and small RNAs from three parts of an early maturation stage seed: seed coat (EM-SC), embryonic cotyledons (EM-COT), and embryonic axis (EM-AX).",29078418,"We profiled soybean and <i>Arabidopsis</i> methylomes from the globular stage through dormancy and germination to understand the role of methylation in seed formation. CHH methylation increases significantly during development throughout the entire seed, targets primarily transposable elements (TEs), is maintained during endoreduplication, and drops precipitously within the germinating seedling. By contrast, no significant global changes in CG- and CHG-context methylation occur during the same developmental period. An <i>Arabidopsis ddcc</i> mutant lacking CHH and CHG methylation does not affect seed development, germination, or major patterns of gene expression, implying that CHH and CHG methylation does not play a significant role in seed development or in regulating seed gene activity. By contrast, over 100 TEs are transcriptionally de-repressed in <i>ddcc</i> seeds, suggesting that the increase in CHH-context methylation may be a failsafe mechanism to reinforce transposon silencing. Many genes encoding important classes of seed proteins, such as storage proteins, oil biosynthesis enzymes, and transcription factors, reside in genomic regions devoid of methylation at any stage of seed development. Many other genes in these classes have similar methylation patterns, whether the genes are active or repressed. Our results suggest that methylation does not play a significant role in regulating large numbers of genes important for programming seed development in both soybean and <i>Arabidopsis.</i> We conclude that understanding the mechanisms controlling seed development will require determining how <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements and their cognate transcription factors are organized in genetic regulatory networks."

Discovery and analysis of sequence and expression variations in these genes will accelerate soybean oil quality improvement. In an effort to identify these variations, we sequenced the transcriptomes of soybean seeds from nine lines varying in oil composition and/or total oil content. Our results showed that 69,338 distinct transcripts from 32,885 annotated genes were expressed in seeds. A total of 8,037 transcript expression polymorphisms and 50,485 transcript sequence polymorphisms (48,792 SNPs and 1,693 small Indels) were identified among the lines. Effects of the transcript polymorphisms on their encoded protein sequences and functions were predicted. The studies also provided independent evidence that the lack of FAD2-1A gene activity and a non-synonymous SNP in the coding sequence of FAB2C caused elevated oleic acid and stearic acid levels in soybean lines M23 and FAM94-41, respectively. As a proof-of-concept, we developed an integrated RNA-seq and bioinformatics approach to identify and functionally annotate transcript polymorphisms, and demonstrated its high effectiveness for discovery of genetic and transcript variations that result in altered oil quality traits. The collection of transcript polymorphisms coupled with their predicted functional effects will be a valuable asset for further discovery of genes, gene variants, and functional markers to improve soybean oil quality.

TasiRNAs have not been extensively described in many plant species. We identified dozens of new miRNAs in Medicago and soybean and confirmed 119 Medicago targets. A search for phased tasiRNA-like small RNAs ('phasiRNAs') found at least 114 Medicago loci, the majority of which were NB-LRR encoding genes. Notably, conserved domains in NB-LRR-encoding RNAs are targeted by several 22-nt miRNA families to trigger phasiRNA production. DCL2 and SGS3 transcripts were also cleaved by these 22-nt miRNAs, generating phased small RNAs, suggesting synchronization between silencing and pathogen defense pathways. A second example of 'two-hit' phasiRNA processing was identified, utilizing miR156-miR172 sites.

As such, the M. truncatula genome sequence provides significant opportunities to expand alfalfa's genomic toolbox."
PRJEB57693,Chambard et al. 2022,Living yeast-based biostimulants: different genes for the same results?,"Nowadays many products are available on the plant biostimulants market. Among these bi-ostimulants, living yeast-based biostimulants are also commercialized. Given the living aspect of these products, the reproducibility of their effects should be investigated to ensure end-users’ confidence in these solutions. This study aimed to compare effects of a living yeast-based bi-ostimulant between two different soybean cultures. These two cultures C1 and C2 were con-ducted on the same variety and soil, but in different locations and dates until VC developmental stage (unifoliate leaves unrolled), with and without biostimulant treatment on seeds. A leaf transcriptomic analysis was conducted in order to characterize the biostimulant effect on these two cultures. This study firstly showed a high gene expression difference between the two cul-tures. Despite this first result, a secondary analysis focusing on the different pathways differen-tially expressed with the biostimulant treatment showed that pathways modulated by the bi-ostimulant treatment were really close between soybean cultures C1 and C2. These results seem to show that the biostimulant effects led to a similar pathway enhancement in plants even if genes expression was different between the two cultures. Pathways which seems to be reproducibly impacted by the living yeast based biostimulant are abiotic stress response, carbohydrate syn-thesis, protein metabolism and glycolysis.",,

This study focuses on founding changes genes between GmSIN1 OE transgenic seedlings and control seedlings under salt stress or non-salt stress conditions. Illumina Solexa sequencing platform was used for the comparative analysis of transcriptome profiles in the roots and leaves of GmSIN1 OE transgenic seedlings and WEI6823 (control) seedlings under mock or 150 mM NaCl treatment for 6 hrs. Overall design: A total of 8 samples was analyzed. Two soybean genotypes, 2 treatment and 2 biological replicates per condition were used.",31227558,"Abscisic acid (ABA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as key signaling molecules in the plant response to salt stress; however, how these signals are transduced and amplified remains unclear. Here, a soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) salinity-induced NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (NAC) transcription factor encoded by <i>SALT INDUCED NAC1</i> (<i>GmSIN1</i>) was shown to be a key component of this process. Overexpression of <i>GmSIN1</i> in soybean promoted root growth and salt tolerance and increased yield under salt stress; RNA interference-mediated knockdown of <i>GmSIN1</i> had the opposite effect. The rapid induction of <i>GmSIN1</i> in response to salinity required ABA and ROS, and the effect of <i>GmSIN1</i> on root elongation and salt tolerance was achieved by boosting cellular ABA and ROS contents. GmSIN1 upregulated 9-<i>cis</i>-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase coding genes in soybean (<i>GmNCED3s</i>, associated with ABA synthesis) and <i>Respiratory burst oxidase homolog B</i> genes in soybean (<i>GmRbohBs</i>, associated with ROS generation) by binding to their promoters at a site that has not been described to date. Together, <i>GmSIN1</i>, <i>GmNCED3s</i>, and <i>GmRbohBs</i> constitute a positive feed-forward system that enables the rapid accumulation of ABA and ROS, effectively amplifying the initial salt stress signal. These findings suggest that the combined modulation of ABA and ROS contents enhances soybean salt tolerance."

To investigate soybean (Glycine max) miRNAs involved in the response to cadmium (Cd), microarrays containing 953 unique miRNA probes were employed to identify differences in the expression patterns of the miRNAs between different genotypes, Huaxia3 (HX3, Cd-tolerant) and Zhonghuang24 (ZH24, Cd-sensitive). Twenty six Cd-responsive miRNAs were identified in total. Among them, nine were detected in both cultivars, while five were expressed only in HX3 and 12 were only in ZH24. The expression of 16 miRNAs was tested by qRT-PCR and most of the identified miRNAs were found to have similar expression patterns with microarray. Three hundred and seventy six target genes were identified for 204 miRNAs from a mixture degradome library, which was constructed from the root of HX3 and ZH24 with or without Cd treatment. Fifty five genes were identified to be cleaved by 14 Cd-responsive miRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) annotations showed that these target transcripts are implicated in a broad range of biological processes. In addition, the expression patterns of ten target genes were validated by qRT-PCR. The characterization of the miRNAs and the associated target genes in response to Cd exposure provides a framework for understanding the molecular mechanism of heavy metal tolerance in plants."

It is important to balance nitrogen levels to meet both growth and nodulation needs. In this study, the relieve effect of humic acid on soybean nodulation inhibition under high nitrogen condition was studied, and transcriptomic analysis was used to understand the mechanism. Results showed that lower nitrogen level with 36.4 mg urea per pot can increase the nodule numbers of soybean, and higher nitrogen level with 145.9 mg urea per pot (U4 group) had the best growth indicators, but inhibit nodulation significantly. HA relieved the inhibitory, and the nodule number incresed by 122.1 % compared with U4 group, when 1.29 g HA was added (H2 group). Transcriptome analysis showed a total 2995 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the 25th day, accounting for 5.66% of the total annotation gene (44848), under test conditions.

Clark standard, CS) and a mutant (cv. Clark glabrous, i.e., trichomeless or hairless, CG) soybean isoline that carries the dominant P1 allele. DGE data and RNA-Seq data were mapped to the cDNAs (Glyma models) predicted from the reference soybean genome, Williams 82. Extending the model length by 250 bp at both ends resulted in significantly more matches of authentic DGE tags indicating that many of the predicted gene models are prematurely truncated at the 5’ and 3’ UTRs. The genome-wide comparative study of the transcript profiles of the wild-type versus mutant line revealed a number of differentially expressed genes. One highly-expressed gene, Glyma04g35130, in wild-type soybean was of interest as it has high homology to the cotton gene GhRDL1 gene that has been identified as being involved in cotton fiber initiation and is a member of the BURP protein family. Sequence comparison of Glyma04g35130 among Williams 82 with our sequences derived from CS and CG isolines revealed various SNPs and indels including addition of one nucleotide C in the CG and insertion of ~60 bp in the third exon of CS that causes a frameshift mutation and premature truncation of peptides in both lines as compared to Williams 82.

Although the pathways for lipid biosynthesis in higher plants have been uncovered, our understanding of regulatory mechanism controlling lipid accumulation is still limited. In this study, we identified 87 transcription factor genes with a higher abundance at the stage of lipid accumulation in soybean seeds. One of these genes, GmbZIP123, was selected to further study its function in regulation of lipid accumulation. Overexpression of GmbZIP123 enhanced lipid content in the seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. The GmbZIP123 transgene promoted expression of two sucrose transporter genes (SUC1 and SUC5) and three cell-wall invertase genes (cwINV1, cwINV3, and cwINV6) by binding directly to the promoters of these genes. Consistently, the cell-wall invertase activity and sugar translocation were all enhanced in siliques of GmbZIP123 transgenic plants. Higher levels of glucose, fructose, and sucrose were also found in seeds of GmbZIP123 transgenic plants. These results suggest that GmbZIP123 may participate in regulation of lipid accumulation in soybean seeds by controlling sugar transport into seeds from photoautotrophic tissues. This study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for lipid accumulation in seeds and may facilitate improvements in oil production in soybean and other oil crops through genetic manipulation of the GmbZIP123 gene."

PRJNA324419,Glycine max,Fine mapping and candidate gene analysis of two loci conferring resistance to Phytophthora sojae in soybean,"Phytophthora root and stem rot caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora sojae, is one of the most destructive diseases of soybean. Deploying soybean cultivars carrying race-specific resistance conferred by Rps genes is the most practicalapproach to managing this disease. Previously, two Rps genes, RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 conferring broad spectra of resistance to P. sojae isolates, were identified in a landrace PI 567139B and mapped to a 6.5-cM region on chromosome 3 and a 3.0-cM region on chromosome 16, corresponding to 840 kb and 600 kb of sequences, respectively,of the soybean reference genome. By analyzing ten and nine recombinants defined by genotypic and phenotypic screening of the 826 F2:3 families derived from two reciprocal crosses between the two parental lines of the mapping populations, RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 were further narrowed to a 151-kb region that harbors five genes including three NBS-LRR genes, and a 36-kb region that contains four genes including five NBS-LRR genes, respectively, according to the reference genome. Analysis of expressional changes of these nine genes before and after inoculation with the pathogen suggest that the counterparts of Glyma.03g034600 in the RpsUN1 region and the counterparts of Glyma.16g215200 and Glyma.16g214900 in the RpsUN2 region of PI 567139B may be associated with the resistance to P. sojae. It is also suggested that unequal recombination between different NBS-LRR genes in the mapped regions may have occurred, resulting in the formation of two recombinants with inconsistent genotypes and phenotypes detected by molecular markers within the fine-mapped regions. The haplotypes of genomic regions surrounding RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 in the entire soybean germplasm deposited in the US soybean germplasm collection were analyzed towards a better understanding of the origins of these two novel sources of resistance and screening of effective markers for marker-assisted selectionof these two resistance genes for soybean breeding. Overall design: 2 samples were sequenced, 1 inoculated with P. sojae, the other 1 were mock-inoculated",,
PRJNA284751,Transcriptional and proteomic analyses of different herbivore-induced responses in a wild soybean line ED059 and a cultivar Tianlong 2,Transcriptional and proteomic analyses of different herbivore-induced responses in a wild soybean line ED059 and a cultivar Tianlong 2,"Soybean is one of the main sources of oil worldwide, and the cotton bollworm [Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner)] is one of the common herbivores seriously affecting soybean production. After being attacked by herbivores, multiple signaling patheways will be triggered in plants, which induces the production of toxic, repellent, or anti-digestive compounds. Genetic engineering and breeding of resistant plant lines are the most effective and environmentally friendly approaches to control herbivores and improve the performance of plants. This study focuses on founding changes genes and proteins in soybean defense response induced by H. armigera. Illumina Solexa sequencing platform and iTRAQ were used for the comparative analysis of transcriptome and proteome profiles in the leaves of Tianlong 2 (a cultivated soybean susceptible to herbivores) and ED059 (a wild soybean resistant to herbivores) in response to infestation by H. armigera. Transcriptome data show that 2073 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were uniquely expressed in ED059 compared with those in Tianlong 2 after 24 h of H. armigera treatment. Based on gene ontology classification of these 2073 DEGs, we identified 233 DEGs corresponded to various signaling pathways, including protein kinases, transcriptional factors, hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways. In addition, a large number of genes related to antinutritive or toxic proteins were special induced in ED059. By combining the gene expression at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, results reveal that no significantly high correlation was detected between the expression of mRNAs and proteins. Functional analysis of three candidate genes was accomplished by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in Arabidopsis thaliana, and a MYB transcription factor 109 (MYB109) was identified with herbivore defense function in ED059. This study provides insights into the identification of the potential genes and proteins involved in herbivore defense, and a possible understanding of the herbivore defense mechanism in a wild soybean by combining analysis of transcriptome and proteome data. Moreover, a novel gene associated with herbivore resistance function was identified and validated. Overall design: Totally four samples, two treatments and two genotypes.",,

PRJDB3582,Glycine max strain:Enrei,RNAseqs for transcriptome analysis of soybean (Glycine max L.; 2n=20) cultivar ENREI were s equenced.,"Soybean (Glycine max L.; 2n=20) is one of the world's most important leguminous crops and a major source of proteins, oils, and other physiologically active substances. In Japan, soybean is a crop that has been eaten from ancient times, as a valuable source of fermented products such as miso, soy sauce, and natto, and non-fermented products such as tofu and soymilk. In order to facilitate improvement of Japanese soybean cultivars, a large-scale analysis of an elite soybean cultivar Enrei has been initiated. The genome project aims to (1) determine a draft genome sequence of cultivated Enrei using next-generation sequencing technology, (2) characterize the genome by comparative analysis with the completely sequenced soybean cultivar Williams 82, and (3) elucidate the genes involved in many agronomic traits that can be used for improvement of Japanese soybean cultivars.",10.1155/2015/358127,"We elucidated the genome sequence of Glycine max cv. Enrei to provide a reference for characterization of Japanese domestic soybean cultivars. The whole genome sequence obtained using a next-generation sequencer was used for reference mapping into the current genome assembly of G. max cv. Williams 82 obtained by the Soybean Genome Sequencing Consortium in the USA. After sequencing and assembling the whole genome shotgun reads, we obtained a data set with about 928&#x2009;Mbs total bases and 60,838 gene models. Phylogenetic analysis provided glimpses into the ancestral relationships of both cultivars and their divergence from the complex that include the wild relatives of soybean. The gene models were analyzed in relation to traits associated with anthocyanin and flavonoid biosynthesis and an overall profile of the proteome. The sequence data are made available in DAIZUbase in order to provide a comprehensive informatics resource for comparative genomics of a wide range of soybean cultivars in Japan and a reference tool for improvement of soybean cultivars worldwide."
