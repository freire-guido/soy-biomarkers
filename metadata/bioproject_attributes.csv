In this study, the physiological analysis of soybean seedlings under B deficiency (T1, T2, T3, T4) and control (CK1, CK2, CK3, CK4) after 12 h, 24 h, 72 h, and 8 d was carried out, and the roots were subjected to transcriptome sequencing analysis. The results showed that under B deficiency, the plant height, SPAD, and chlorophyll fluorescence value (Fv/Fm) of soybean seedlings decreased significantly, indicating that B stresses significantly inhibited plant growth and photosynthesis. After RNA-seq sequencing, showed a total of 5126 DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) were obtained, including 953 DEGs at 12 h, 760 DEGs at 24 h, 1945 DEGs at 72 h and 1468 DEGs at 8 d. There were 9Nine DEGs co-existed at the four-time treatmentspoints, among which GLYMA_03G130600 regulated regulates transcription factor ORG3, which was is related to plant growth. GO analysis showed thatrevealed a total of annotated 8763 DEGs were annotated, among which the terms plasma membrane, extracellular, enzyme activity, ion transport metabolic process and oxidoreductase activity were significantly enriched at the four -time treatmentspoints, which might hinder the growth of soybean and accelerate senescence. KEGG analysis showed that at level 1, the DEGs were mainly enriched in photosynthesis-related, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction. At level 2 of secondary metabolism, the DEGs were mainly enriched in energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism pathways, which indicates that B stresses mainly affect photosynthesis, hormone regulation and amino acid metabolism of soybean, thus affecting plant growth.

We dissected emerging nodules (EN), mature nodules (MN), emerging lateral roots (ELR) and young lateral roots (YLR), and constructed strand-specific RNAseq libraries using polyA-enriched RNA preparations. Root sections above and below these organs devoid of any lateral organs were used to construct respective control tissue libraries (ABEN, ABMN, ABELR, ABYLR respectively). High sequence quality, predominant mapping to coding sequences, and consistency between replicates indicated that the RNAseq libraries were of very high quality. We identified genes enriched in emerging nodules, mature nodules, emerging lateral roots and young lateral roots in soybean by comparing global gene expression profiles between each of these organs and adjacent root segments.

Much of our knowledge of IDC stress responses is derived from model plant species. Gene expression, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed in soybean suggest that stress response differences exist between model and crop species. Our current understanding of the molecular response to IDC in soybeans is largely derived from gene expression studies using near-isogenic lines differing in iron efficiency. To improve iron efficiency in soybeans and other crops, we need to expand gene expression studies to include the diversity present in germplasm collections. Therefore, we collected 216 purified RNA samples (18 genotypes, two tissue types [leaves and roots], two iron treatments [sufficient and deficient], three replicates) and used RNA sequencing to examine the expression differences of 18 diverse soybean genotypes in response to iron deficiency. We found a rapid response to iron deficiency across genotypes, most responding within 60 min of stress. There was little evidence of an overlap of specific differentially expressed genes, and comparisons of gene ontology terms and transcription factor families suggest the utilization of different pathways in the stress response. These initial findings suggest an untapped genetic potential within the soybean germplasm collection that could be used for the continued improvement of iron efficiency in soybean.', 'doi': '10.3390/ijms222111643'}"

Further analyses revealed that the mutated allele perfectly co-segregated with the phenotype, and a wild-type soybean NAP1 transgene functionally complemented the Arabidopsis nap1 mutant (grl-4). Additionally, mapping and exon sequencing of NAP1 in a spontaneous soybean gnarled trichome mutant (T31) identified a frame shift mutation resulting in a truncation of the coding region. These data indicate that the soybean NAP1 gene is essential for proper trichome development and that the soybean gnarled phenotype resulted from complex structural rearrangements induced by fast neutron mutagenesis at the NAP1 locus'}"

These characteristics have made it a valuable addition to the northern soybean breeding programs in the US and Canada. Conversely, Mandarin(Ottawa) is highly susceptible to disease and suffers severe phenotypic damage and yield loss when exposed to abiotic stresses such as iron deficiency, a major challenge to soybean production in the northern Midwestern United States. Using RNA-seq, we characterize the transcriptional response to iron deficiency in both Fiskeby III and Mandarin(Ottawa) to better understand abiotic stress tolerance. Previous work by our group identified a quantitative trait loci (QTL) region on chromosome 5 associated with Fiskeby III iron efficiency (Merry et al. 2019).

Coupling virus induced gene silencing with RNA-seq, we identified a single high priority candidate gene that has a significant impact on iron deficiency response pathways.

Firstly, the germination potential of LX was investigated which confirmed the previous report that LX germinated better at drought stress conditions. Additionally, LX plants accumulated more anthocyanin at both normal and stress conditions, and exhibited better resistance to drought treatment comparing to William82. When grown at the same condition, the LX plants are greener than control lines and contain more chlorophyll. Collection of biochemical measurements all indicated that LX is more physiologically adaptive to stress conditions. Using untargeted mass spectrometry analysis in combination with transcriptomics analysis, we revealed the chemical diversity and genetic basis underlying the overall performance of LX landrace at the designed growth conditions. Under both normal and stress conditions, significant differences in the expressions of a suite of secondary metabolism genes, particularly the genes from general phenylpropanoid pathway, were detected in LX comparing to William82 plants. Consistently, correlating with the transcript analysis, a set of corresponding secondary metabolites with profoundly different accumulations were also detected in LX plants. Further correlation analysis between metabolites and transcripts pointed to a MYB transcription factor likely sitting at the top of the regulation module, which is responsible for the LX agronomic traits.

To understand the regulatory mechanisms and identify key genes that intervene in the seed development process in low phytic acid crops, we performed computational inference of gene regulatory networks in low and normal phytic acid soybeans using a time course transcriptomic data and multiple network inference algorithms. We identified several transcription factors and their regulatory interactions with genes that have functions in myo-inositol biosynthesis, auxin-ABA signaling and seed dormancy. We validated the predicted regulatory network by comparing it with published regulatory interactions in Arabidopsis. Some regulatory interactions were found in the low phytic acid mutants but not in non-mutant plants. These findings provide important hypotheses on expression regulation of myo-inositol metabolism, and phytohormone signaling in developing low phytic acid soybeans. The computational pipeline used for unsupervised network learning in this study is provided as open source software and is freely available at https://lilabatvt.github.io/LPANetwork/. Overall design: Four soybean experimental lines designated as: (i) 3mlpa, (ii) 3MWT, (iii) 1mlpa, and (iv) 1MWT were used in this study. The lpa mutant line, ‘3mlpa’, carrying three mutations mips1/mrp-l/mrp-n, and its non-mutant sibling line with normal phytic acid, ‘3MWT’, were derived from crossing of ‘CX-1834’ (lpa line with two mpr-l/mrp-n mutations on soybean chromosomes 19 and 3, respectively) with ‘V99-5089’ (lpa line with single mips1 mutation) (Saghai Maroof et al., 2009). Another lpa line, ‘1mlpa’, carrying a single mips1 mutation on soybean chromosome 11, and its isogenic sibling line with normal phytic acid, ‘1MWT’, were derived from crossing of ‘Essex’ (a normal phytic acid line with no mutations) with V99-5089 (Saghai Maroof and Buss, 2008; Glover, 2011).

Because soybean is a vital source of vegetable protein worldwide, producers are concerned about increasing the total amount of protein in the seed without substantially lowering the amount of oil, another economically important product. Here we describe a transgenic soybean line with increased protein and protein/oil ratio, containing an average of 42.2% protein vs. 38.5% in controls and with a protein/oil ratio of 2.02 vs. 1.76 in controls over several generations of greenhouse growth. Other phenotypic data show that the seeds are heavier, although there are overall lower yields per plant. We postulate these effects result from insertion site mutagenesis by the transgenic construct. As this line never achieves homozygosity and appears to be embryo lethal when homozygous, one functional copy of the gene is most likely essential for normal seed development. Global transcript analyses using RNA-Seq for 88,000 gene models over two stages of cotyledon development revealed that more genes are over-expressed in the transgenic line including ribosomal protein related genes and those in the membrane protein and transporters families. Localization of the insertion site should reveal the genes and developmental program that has been perturbed by the transgenic construct, resulting in this economically interesting increase in protein and the protein/oil ratio. Overall design: 26 RNA-Seq samples from two stages of immature cotyledons, 10-25mg and 100-200mg, across 2 generations of plants. They include Jack control plants; mutants positively identified as having the transgenic construct (transformed transgenic); and mutant offspring that nonetheless did not contain the transgenic construct (transformed non-transgenic), indicating the lines did not become homozygous. There were 3 replicates per stage for the Jack controls; 3 replicates per stage for the transformed but non-transgenic plants; and 7 replicates per stage for the transformed transgenic plants.', 'doi': '32516314'}"

Evening Complex (EC) components soybean LUX1, LUX2, and ELF3a are critical for flowering and adaptation to lower latitudes. However, the mechanisms of EC in regulating flowering time remain largely unclear in soybean. Here, we identified GmJMJ19 and GmJMJ20 gene paralogs encoding JmjC-domain containing proteins, which co-express and interact with GmLUX2. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that GmJMJ19 and GmJMJ20 bind to histone, but lack histone demethylase activity. Notably, simultaneous mutation of GmJMJ19 and GmJMJ20 causes delayed flowering time. Further transcriptomic, CUT&amp;Tag and ChIP-seq analyses show that GmJMJ19/20 and GmLUX2 primarily co-repress transcription of 168 genes, which are not associated with the alternation of examined histone methylation state. Strikingly, we identify that the direct repression of GmSVP by GmJMJ19/20-GmLUX2 module is independent of the classical EC-E1 pathway. Interestingly, haplotype analyses support the idea that GmJMJ19 might undergo selection during soybean expansion to lower latitude. In summary, our findings reveal a mechanistic insight of GmJMJ19/20-GmLUX2 into flowering time control beyond EC complex in plants and also provide resources for improving soybean adaptability through molecular breeding.

Small RNA sequencing of dissected regions of immature seed coats demonstrated that CHS siRNA levels cause the patterns produced by the i-i and i-k alleles of the I locus, which restrict pigment to the hilum or saddle region of the seed coat, respectively. To identify the K1 locus, we compared RNA-Seq data from dissected regions of two Clark isolines having similar saddle phenotypes mediated by CHS siRNAs but different genotypes (homozygous i-k K1 versus homozygous i-i k1). By examining differentially expressed genes, mapping information, and genome resequencing, we identified a 129-bp deletion in Glyma.11G190900 encoding Argonaute5 (AGO5), a member of the Argonaute family. Amplicon sequencing of several independent saddle pattern mutants from different genetic backgrounds revealed independent lesions affecting AGO5, thus establishing Glyma.11G190900 as the K1 locus. Non-functional AGO5 from k1 alleles leads to altered distributions of CHS siRNAs, thus explaining how the k1 mutation reverses the phenotype of the seed coat regions from yellow to pigmented, even in the presence of the normally dominant I or i-i alleles. Overall design: Immature seed coats of 100-200 mg with chimeric pigmented phenotypes of Clark 8 (i-k, K1) or Clark 18a (i-i, k1) were separated into the regions destined to become either the black saddle region or the yellow sections.

Transcriptomic analyses were performed on near isogenic lines (NILs) with the Rag2 allele for aphid resistance or rag2 for susceptibility at the Rag2 locus. Soybeans were infested with soybean aphids and leaves were collected at 0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours after infestation. RNA were extracted and a high throughput RNA-seq approach was used to examine mRNA expression in Rag2 and rag2 soybean leaves. The expression of ~43,000 genes was detected in both the Rag2 and rag2 leaves. Statistical analysis identified 2361 genes significantly regulated between the resistant and susceptible lines at different times after aphid infestation. Genes found up-regulated in the Rag2 line were annotated as involved in the cell wall, secondary and hormone metabolism, as well as in stress, signaling and transcriptional responses. Genes found up-regulated in the rag2 line were annotated as involved in photosynthesis and carbon metabolism. Interestingly, mRNAs of 2 genes (unknown and mitochondrial protease) located within the Rag2 locus were expressed significantly higher in the resistant genotype. The expression of the putative NBS-LRR resistant gene present in the Rag2 locus was not different between the two soybean lines. However, another NBL-LRR gene located just at the border of the Rag2 locus was and, therefore, may be involved in the differential resistance to aphid infestation exhibited by the two NIL genotypes analyzed.

Aphids divert plant assimilates for their nutrition, causing yield losses of up to 50%. One of the management options for soybean aphids is cultivation of resistant soybean varieties. Aphid resistance in soybean is conferred by Resistance to Aphis glycines (Rag) genes with Rag1 and Rag2 being the most studied to date. Under insect attack, plants respond by inducing defenses which primarily consist of morphological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms. Previous studies showed that aphid populations were significantly lower in the double pyramid (Rag1Rag2) genotypes compared to soybean genotypes that contained the Rag1 or Rag2 gene alone. We hypothesized that pyramiding Rag1 and Rag2 in one soybean genotype had an additive or synergistic effect on aphid resistance at the molecular level. To test this idea, the transcriptional response of four near isogenic soybean genotypes (one aphid-susceptible and three aphid-resistant: Rag1, Rag2 and Rag1Rag2) to aphid feeding was measured at 6 and 12 hours, using RNA sequencing. Comparison of mock-treated samples versus aphid-treated samples for each soybean genotype showed that the transcriptional response to feeding by soybean aphids involved unique sets of genes and shared genes respectively at both time points. Biological processes modified due to aphid feeding were distinctive for each of the soybean genotypes at 6 hours but similar among them at the 12 hour time point. The transcriptional response of the Rag1Rag2 soybean genotype to feeding by soybean aphids at both time points involved unique sets of genes that were absent in the Rag1 or Rag2 response; suggesting that pyramiding the Rag1 and Rag2 genes in one soybean genotype has a synergistic effect on aphid resistance at the molecular level. This research will build the knowledge base on aphid resistance, contributing to better management of soybean aphids and optimization of soybean yields.'}"

While resistance mechanisms against Phytophthora sojae have been extensively studied, the molecular basis underlying immune responses to the newly recognized pathogen, Phytophthora sansomeana, remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated transcriptomic and epigenetic responses of two resistant (Colfax and NE2701) and two susceptible (Williams 82 and Senaki) soybean lines at four time points (2, 4, 8, and 16 hours post inoculation, hpi) after P. sansomeana inoculation. Through comparative transcriptomic analyses, we identified a greater number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upon pathogen inoculation in the resistant lines compared to the susceptible lines, predominantly at 8 and 16 hpi. These DEGs were associated with multiple phytohormones, including ethylene, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid, along with various transcription factors and signaling cascade proteins. Moreover, DE transposable elements (TEs) were predominantly up-regulated after inoculation, and we found that TEs differentially transcribed in a resistant line were enriched near genes. Notably, we identified a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that was significantly differentially transcribed after inoculation exclusively in the resistant lines, potentially regulating two flanking LURP-one-related genes, known as key defense mediators in Arabidopsis against oomycete pathogens. Furthermore, DNA methylation analysis revealed increased CHH (H = A, T, or C) methylation levels in lncRNAs after inoculation, with delayed responses in the resistant line compared to the susceptible line. Overall, our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to P. sansomeana in soybean and underscore the potential role of lncRNAs and epigenetic regulation in plant defense responses.

In the present work, a RNA-seq-based analysis was used for the first time to investigate the molecular aspect of the interaction of a partially resistant soybean genotype with non-pathogenic/pathogenic isolates of F. oxysporum at 72 and 96 hours post inoculation (hpi). Markedly different gene expression profiles were observed in compatible and incompatible host-pathogen combinations. A peak of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was observed at 72 hpi in soybean roots in response to both isolates, although the number of DEGs was about eight times higher for the pathogenic isolate compared to the non-pathogenic one (1,659 vs. 203 DEGs, respectively). Furthermore, not only the number of genes, but also the magnitude of induction was much greater in response to the pathogenic isolate. This response included a stronger activation of many well-known defense-related genes, and several genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, transcription factors, secondary and sugar metabolism. In addition, 1130 fungal genes were differentially expressed between the F. oxysporum isolates in planta during the infection process. Interestingly, 10% of these genes encode plant cell-wall degrading enzymes, reactive oxygen species-related enzymes and fungal proteins involved in primary metabolic pathways.

We assessed detailed temporal transcriptional and metabolic changes in developing soybean embryos to gain a systems biology view of developmental and metabolic changes and to identify potential targets for metabolic engineering. Two major developmental and metabolic transitions were captured enabling identification of potential metabolic engineering targets specific to seed filling and to desiccation. The first transition involved a switch between different types of metabolism in dividing and elongating cells. The second transition involved the onset of maturation and desiccation tolerance during seed filling and a switch from photoheterotrophic to heterotrophic metabolism. Clustering analyses of metabolite and transcript data revealed clusters of functionally related metabolites and transcripts active in these different developmental and metabolic programs. The gene clusters provide a resource to generate predictions about the associations and interactions of unknown regulators with their targets based on guilt-by-association relationships. The inferred regulators also represent potential targets for future metabolic engineering of relevant pathways and steps in central carbon and nitrogen metabolism in soybean embryos and drought and desiccation tolerance in plants.

Current research shows that R genes predominantly function by inducing a hypersensitive reaction (HR), which results in localized cell death thought to restrict pathogen spread. Some R genes elicit a more atypical response where resistance is not associated with HR or the associated gene expression changes, termed extreme resistance (ER). The molecular regulatory mechanism underlying ER is largely unexplored. One of the few known, naturally occurring, instances of ER is resistance derived from the soybean Rsv3 gene, which confers resistance against the most virulent strains of soybean mosaic virus (SMV). To discern the regulatory mechanism underlying the Rsv3-mediated ER reaction, we generated a gene regulatory network using transcriptomic data from a time course comparison of SMV-G7-infected resistant (L29, Rsv3-genotype) and susceptible (Williams82, rsv3-genotype) soybean cultivars. We identified putative interactions between transcription factors (TFs) regulating gene expression in hormone regulatory pathways, such as abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA). This is consistent with the demonstrated involvement of these pathways in Rsv3-mediated resistance. We found significant enrichment for the G-box motif (“CACGTG”) among genes implicated in ABA- and JA-related activities. This motif is specifically recognized by MYC2, which is a master regulator of ABA and JA signaling. Our network identified a MYC2 TF encoded by Glyma.07G051500 as a putative transcriptional regulator whose expression was significantly down-regulated in L29. This correlated with the down-regulation of expression of genes involved in ABA and JA processes. Our results suggest an important function for Glyma.07G051500 in ABA and JA derived defense signaling. Additionally, our regulatory network found other putative TFs with differential expression, such as MYBs and ERFs, which may also be involved in regulating ABA and JA signaling for defense. The regulatory network presented here offers new insights into the regulation of the molecular defense mechanism underlying Rsv3-mediated ER against SMV. Overall design: The soybean cultivars ‘L29’ (Rsv3-genotype; resistant) and ‘Williams82’ (rsv3-genotype; susceptible) were used in this study. The Rsv3-genotype confers ER to the most virulent strains of SMV. Thus the goal of this study was to investigate the regulation of the Rsv3-mediated ER molecular defense mechanism against SMV. Plants were grown in controlled greenhouse conditions and inoculated at first, fully, expanded trifoliolate stage with SMV strain G7 (SMV-G7). Unifoliolate leaves were dusted with carborundum powder and rubbed with SMV-G7 inoculum. The inoculated unifoliolate leaves were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post inoculation (hpi) and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction.

A total of 20 mRNA libraries (= 2 cultivars x 5 time-points x 2 biological replicates) were prepared from duplicate RNA samples of each line at each time point and sequenced as 150PE with Illumina HiSeq4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) at Novogene, Sacramento, CA.', 'doi': '32315334'}"

Although overall adaptations of plant roots to P deficiency have been extensively studied, fragmentary information is available in regards to root nodule responses to P deficiency. In this study, genome wide transcriptome analysis was conducted using RNA-seq analysis to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying soybean (Glycine max) nodule adaptation to phosphate (Pi) starvation. Phosphorus deficiency significantly decreased soybean nodule growth and nitrogenase activity. Nodule Pi concentrations declined by 49% in response to P deficiency, but this was well below the 87% and 88% decreases observed in shoots and roots, respectively. Nodule transcript profiling revealed that a total of 2,055 genes exhibited differential expression patterns between Pi sufficient and deficient conditions. A set of DEGs appeared to be involved in maintaining Pi homeostasis in soybean nodules, including 8 Pi transporters (PTs), 8 proteins containing the SYG1/PHO81/XPR1 domain (SPXs), and 16 purple acid phosphatases (PAPs). The results suggest that a complex transcriptional regulatory network participates in soybean nodule adaption to Pi starvation, most notable a Pi signaling pathway specifically involved in maintaining Pi homeostasis in nodules.

To investigate transcriptional changes in soybean roots in response to B. simplex Sneb45 treatment, transcriptome analysis and quantitative real-time PCR were conducted to detect and validate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In total, 19,109 DEGs were obtained. After B. simplex Sneb545 treatment, 970 and 1265 genes were up- and down-regulated at 5 days post-inoculation (dpi), respectively, and 142 and 47 genes were up- and down-regulated at 10 dpi, respectively, compared with untreated soybean roots. Functional annotation of DEGs indicated that B. simplex Sneb545 regulated soybean growth and defense against cyst nematode possibly through genes related to auxin, gibberellin, and NB-LRR protein. In addition, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that the DEGs were enriched in metabolism, signal transduction, and plant-pathogen interaction pathways. Moreover, the auxin and gibberellin contents were lower in B. simplex Sneb545-treated soybean roots than in untreated roots at 5 dpi.

However, perturbations in phytic acid biosynthesis are associated with poor seed vigor. Since the benefits of the low phytic acid trait, in terms of end-use quality and sustainability, far outweigh the negatives associated with poor seed performance, a fuller understanding of the molecular basis behind the negatives will assist crop breeders and engineers in producing variates with low phytic acid and better germination rate. The gene regulatory network for developing low and normal phytic acid soybean seeds was previously constructed, with genes modulating a variety of processes pertinent to phytic acid metabolism and seed viability being identified. In this study, a comparative time series analysis of low and normal phytic acid soybeans was carried out to investigate the transcriptional regulatory elements governing the transitional dynamics from dry seed to germinated seed. Gene regulatory networks were reverse engineered from time series transcriptomic data of three distinct genotypic subsets composed of low phytic acid soybean lines and their normal phytic acid sibling lines. Using a robust unsupervised network inference scheme, putative regulatory interactions were inferred for each subset of genotypes. These interactions were further validated by published regulatory interactions found in Arabidopsis thaliana and motif sequence analysis. Results indicate that low phytic acid seeds have increased sensitivity to stress, which could be due to changes in phytic acid levels, disrupted inositol phosphate signaling, disrupted phosphate ion homeostasis, and altered myo-inositol metabolism. Putative regulatory interactions were identified for the latter two processes. Changes in abscisic acid signaling candidate transcription factors putatively regulating genes in this process were identified as well. Analysis of the gene regulatory networks reveal altered regulation in processes that may be affecting the germination of low phytic acid soybean seeds. Therefore, this work contributes to the ongoing effort to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying altered seed viability, germination and field emergence of low phytic acid crops, understanding of which is necessary in order to mitigate these problems. Overall design: The four genotypic lines used in this study are designated as “MRP,” contains four near isogenic lines, the lpa line “2mlpa” (mrp-l and mrp-n mutations) and three normal phytic acid lines, “2MWT” (no mutation), “2MWT-L” (mrp-n mutation only), and “2MWT-N” (mrp-l mutation only). These lines were developed from a cross between the lpa lines “CX-1834” (mrp-1 and mrp-n mutations) and the normal phytic acid line V99-5089. The mutations conferring the lpa trait in 2mlpa and CX-1834 are the result of point mutations in the epistatically interacting loci, MRP-L and MRP-N, on chromosomes 19 and 3, respectively (Wilcox et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2006; Maroof et al., 2009).

Moreover, the most divergent stage in gene expression between wild and cultivated soybeans occurred during seed development around the cotyledon stage (15 days after fertilization, G15). A module in which the coexpressed genes were significantly downregulated at G15 of wild soybeans was identified. The divergent clusters and modules included substantial differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wild and cultivated soybeans related to cell division, storage compound accumulation, hormone-response, and seed maturation processes. Chromosomal-linked DEGs, quantitative trait loci controlling seed weight and oil content, and selection sweeps revealed candidate DEGs at G15 in the fruit-related divergence of G. max and G. soja. Our work establishes a transcriptomic selection mechanism for altering gene expression during soybean domestication, thus shedding light on the molecular networks underlying soybean seed development and breeding strategy.', 'doi': '30113693'}"

However, the mechanism for aphid resistance in soybean is remain enigmatic, very little information is available about the different mechanisms between antibiosis and antixenosis genotypes. Here we dissected aphid infestation into three stages and used genome-wide gene expression profiling to investigate the underlying aphid-plant interaction mechanisms. Approximately 990 million raw reads in total were obtained, the high expression correlation in each genotype between infestation and non-infestation indicated that the response to aphid was controlled by a small subset of important genes. Moreover, plant response to aphid infestation was more rapid in resistant genotypes. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), a total of 901 transcription factor (TF) genes categorized to 40 families were identified with distinct expression patterns, of which AP2/ERF, MYB and WRKY families were proposed to playing dominated roles. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that these genes had either similar or distinct expression patterns in genotypes. Besides, JA-responsive pathway was domination in aphid-soybean interaction compared to SA pathway, which was not involved plant response to aphid in susceptible and antixenotic genotypes but played an important role in antibiosis one. Throughout, callose were deposited in all genotypes but it was more rapidly and efficiently in antibiotic one. However, reactive oxygen species were not involved in response to aphid attack in resistant genotypes during aphid infestation. Our study helps uncover important genes associated with aphid-attack response in antibiosis and antixenotic genotypes of soybean.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and targeted metabolomics showed that WSHM could regulate the content and distribution of endogenous hormones in the roots, stems, and leaves of soybean plants at the initial stage of soybean nodulation. Transcriptomic analysis showed a total of 2406 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by the 25th day under test conditions, accounting for 4.89 % of total annotation genes (49159). These DEGs were found to contribute primarily to the MAPK signaling pathway, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and plant hormone signal transduction, according to the -log10 (Padjust) value in the KEGG pathway. Subsequently, DEGs related to these hormones were selected for verification using Quantity-PCR.

Transcripts representing 216 unique genes demonstrated a higher level of translational activity in at least one stage by exhibiting higher translational efficiencies (TEs) in which there were relatively more ribosome footprint sequence reads mapping to the transcript than were present in the control total RNA sample. The majority of these transcripts were more translationally active at the early stage of seed development and included 12 unique serine or cysteine proteases and 16 2S albumin and low molecular weight cysteine-rich proteins that may serve as substrates for turnover and mobilization early in seed development. It would appear that the serine proteases and 2S albumins play a vital role in the early stages. In contrast, our investigation of profiles of 19 genes encoding high abundance seed storage proteins, such as glycinins, beta-conglycinins, lectin, and Kunitz trypsin inhibitors, showed that they all had similar patterns in which the TE values started at low levels and increased approximately 2 to 6-fold during development. The highest levels of these seed protein transcripts were found at the mid-developmental stage, whereas the highest ribosome footprint levels of only up to 1.6 TE were found at the late developmental stage. These experimental findings suggest that the major seed storage protein coding genes are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level during normal soybean cotyledon development. Finally, our analyses also identified a total of 370 unique gene models that showed very low TE values including over 48 genes encoding ribosomal family proteins and 95 gene models that are related to energy and photosynthetic functions, many of which have homology to the chloroplast genome.

Its productivity is significantly hampered by salt stress, which impairs plant growth and development by affecting gene expression, in part, through epigenetic modification of chromatin status. However, little is known about epigenetic regulation of stress response in soybean roots. Here, we used RNA-seq and ChIP-seq technologies to study the dynamics of genome-wide transcription and histone methylation patterns in soybean roots under salt stress. 8798 soybean genes changed their expression under salt stress treatment. Whole-genome ChIP-seq study of an epigenetic repressive mark, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), revealed the changes in H3K27me3 deposition during the response to salt stress. Unexpectedly, we found that most of the inactivation of genes under salt stress is strongly correlated with the de novo establishment of H3K27me3 in various parts of the promoter or coding regions where there is no H3K27me3 in control plants. In addition, the soybean histone modifiers were identified which may contribute to de novo histone methylation and gene silencing under salt stress. Thus, dynamic chromatin regulation, switch between active and inactive modes, occur at target loci in order to respond to salt stress in soybean. Our analysis demonstrates histone methylation modifications are correlated with the activation or inactivation of salt-inducible genes in soybean roots.

Results: RNAs were extracted from immature seed from an extended hilum region (i.e., the hilum and a small ring of tissue surrounding the hilum in which the cracks form) at three different developmental stages:10-25, 25-50 and 50-100 mg seed fresh weight in two independent replicates for each stage. The transcriptomes of these samples from both the Clark isoline containing the mi allele (PI 547628, UC413, ii R t mi G), and its recurrent Clark 63 parent isoline (PI 548532, UC7, ii R T Mi g), which was used for six generations of backcrossing, were compared for differential expression of 88,648 Glyma models of the soybean genome Wm82.a2. The RNA sequence data obtained from the 12 cDNA libraries were subjected to padj value &lt;0.05 and at least two-fold expression differences to select with confidence genes differentially expressed in the hilum-containing tissue of the seed coat between the two lines. Glyma.09G008400 annotated as encoding an ethylene forming enzyme, ACC oxidase (ACO), was found to be highly overexpressed in the mi hilum region at 165 RPKMs (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) compared to the standard line at just 0.03 RPKMs. Evidence of changes in expression of genes downstream of the ethylene pathway included those involved in auxin and gibberellin hormone action and extensive differences in expression of cell wall protein genes. These changes are postulated to determine the restricted hilum size and cracking phenotypes. Conclusions: We present transcriptome and phenotypic evidence that substantially higher expression of an ethylene-forming ACO gene likely shifts hormone balance and sets in motion downstream changes resulting in a smaller hilum phenotype and the cracks observed in the minute hilum (mi) isoline as compared to its recurrent parent.

Many HD-Zip genes are characterized in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and members of the family are being investigated for abiotic stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and cucumber (Cucmis sativus). Findings in these species suggest HD-Zip genes as high priority candidates for crop improvement. Results In this study we have identified members of the HD-Zip gene family in soybean cv. 'Williams 82', and characterized their expression under dehydration and salt stress. Homology searches with BLASTP and Hidden Markov Model guided sequence alignments identified 101 HD-Zip genes in the soybean genome. Phylogeny reconstruction coupled with domain and gene structure analyses using soybean, Arabidopsis, rice, grape (Vitis vinifera), and Medicago truncatula homologues enabled placement of these sequences into four previously described subfamilies. Of the 101 HD-Zip genes identified in soybean, 88 exist as whole-genome duplication-derived gene pairs, indicating high retention of these genes following polyploidy in Glycine ~10 Mya. The HD-Zip genes exhibit ubiquitous expression patterns across 24 conditions that include 17 tissues of soybean. An RNA-Seq experiment performed to study differential gene expression at 0, 1, 6 and 12 hr soybean roots under dehydration and salt stress identified 20 differentially expressed (DE) genes. Several of these DE genes are orthologs of genes previously reported to play a role under abiotic stress, implying conservation of HD-Zip gene functions across species. Screening of HD-Zip promoters identified transcription factor binding sites that are overrepresented in the DE genes under both dehydration and salt stress, providing further support for the role of HD-Zip genes in abiotic stress responses. Conclusions We provide a thorough description of soybean HD-Zip genes, and identify potential candidates with probable roles in dehydration and salt stress. Expression profiles generated for all soybean genes, under dehydration and salt stress, at four time points, will serve as an important resource for the soybean research community, and will aid in understanding plant responses to abiotic stress.

To uncover the possible role of epigenetics in gene expression during the transition from seed maturation to seed germination in soybean, the transcriptome of cotyledons from four stages of soybean seed maturation and germination, including mid-late maturation, late maturation, seed dormancy and seed germination, were profiled by Illumina sequencing. For the genes that are quantitatively regulated at the four stages, two antagonistic epigenetic marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, together with the binding of RNA polymerase II, were investigated at the four stages by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). For 10 out of 16 genes examined, the relative enrichment of histone modification marks (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) and RNA polymerase II binding on their promoter regions correlates well with their relative expression levels at four stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetics in transcriptional regulation. A striking finding is that seed germination-specific genes start to show open chromatin (H3K4me3) during late seed maturation although their transcripts do not accumulate, which is further supported by RNA polymerase II binding. Together, our results provide the first evidence that seed germination genes can be primed for transcription (open chromatin and RNA polymerase II binding) during seed maturation, highlighting that the transition from seed maturation to seed germination starts at late seed maturation stages at both the genetic and epigenetic levels.

Methods: mRNA sequencing reads (101SE) were generated in triplicate from five seed developmental stages of 3mlpa and 3MWT soybean line using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Results: A total of 4235 differentially expressed genes, including 512-transcription factor genes were identified. Eighteen biological processes such as apoptosis, glucan metabolism, cellular transport, photosynthesis and 9 transcription factor families including WRKY, CAMTA3 and SNF2 were enriched during seed development. Genes associated with apoptosis, glucan metabolism, and cellular transport showed enhanced expression in early stages of lpa seed development, while those associated with photosynthesis showed decreased expression in late developmental stages. Conclusion: This study provides a global perspective of transcriptomal changes during soybean seed development in 3mlpa mutant. The results suggest that low phtic acid-causing mutations in 3mlpa play a role in inducing and suppressing plant defense responses during early and late stages of seed development, respectively.

The effects of weeds on the soybean transcriptome were evaluated in field conditions during four separate gR1.fastqing seasons. Methods: RNASeq data were collected from 6 biological samples of soybeans gR1.fastqing with or without weeds. Weed species and the methods to maintain weed free controls varied between years to mitigate treatment effects and to allow detection of general soybeans weed responses. Key results: Soybean plants were not visibly nutrient or water stressed. We identified 55 consistently down-regulated genes in weedy plots. Many of the down-regulated genes were heat shock genes. Fourteen genes were consistently up-regulated. Several transcription factors including a PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-like gene (PIF3) were included among the up-regulated genes. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated roles for increased oxidative stress and jasmonic acid signaling responses during weed stress. Main conclusion: The relationship of this weed-induced PIF3 gene to genes involved in shade avoidance responses in arabidopsis provide evidence that this gene may be important in the response of soybean to weeds. These results suggest the weed-induced PIF3 gene will be a target for manipulating weed tolerance in soybean.

RM55-rm is homozygous for a mutable allele (rm) that specifies black and brown striped seeds; RM30-R* is a stable black revertant isoline derived from the mutable line; and RM38-r has brown seed coats due to a recessive r allele shown to translate a truncated MYB protein. Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated RM55-rm line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated TgmR*) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the R locus, Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by R was expressed at only very low levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-R* line, it upregulated expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (ANS2, ANS3) to promote the synthesis of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-R* revertant also carried the 13 kb TgmR* insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13kb TgmR* element. As determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the TgmR* sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-R* than in the mutable RM55-rm progenitor line. The stabilized and more methylated RM30-R* revertant line apparently lacks effective binding of a transposae to its subterminal repeats, thus allowing intron splicing to proceed resulting in sufficient MYB protein to stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats. In this regard, the TgmR* element in soybean resembles McClintock’s Spm-suppressible and change-of-state alleles of maize. This comparison explains the opposite effects of the TgmR* element on intron splicing of the MYB gene in which it resides depending on the methylation state of the element. Overall design: Differential RNA expression of anthocyanin pathway genes in the seed coats of two seed color lines: RM30-R* (black) and RM38-r (brown).

To understand acid tolerance mechanisms, the plant growth, mineral nutrient accumulation and global transcriptome changes in soybean (Glycine max) in response to long-term acid stress were investigated. Results showed that acid stress significantly inhibited soybean root growth, but exhibited slight effects on the shoot growth. Moreover, concentrations of essential mineral nutrients were significantly affected by acid stress, mainly dependent on soybean organs and mineral nutrient types. The concentrations of phosphorus (P) and molybdenum (Mo) in both leaves and roots, nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) in roots and magnesium (Mg) in leaves were significantly decreased, respectively. Whereas, the concentrations of calcium (Ca), sulfate (S) and iron (Fe) were increased in both leaves and roots. Transcriptome analyses in soybean roots resulted in identifying 419 up-regulated and 555 down-regulated genes under acid conditions. A total of 38 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in mineral nutrient transportation.

Rps genes are race-specific, yet the mechanism of resistance, as well as susceptibility, remains largely unclear. Taking advantage of RNA-seq technology, we sequenced the transcriptomes of 10 near isogenic lines (NIL), each with a unique Rps gene, and the recurrent susceptible parent ‘Williams’. A total of 4330 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in ‘Williams’ while 2075 to 5499 DEGs were identified in each NIL. Comparisons between the NILs and ‘Williams’ allowed classification of two major groups of DEGs of interest: incompatible reaction associated genes (IRAGs) and compatible reaction associated genes (CRAGs). Hierarchical cluster analysis divided NILs into three clusters: Cluster I (Rps1-a), Cluster II (Rps1-b, 1-c and 1-k) and Cluster III (Rps3-a, 3-b, 3-c, 4, 5, and 6). Heatmap analysis, along with GO analysis suggested that the diversity of clusters for NILs were likely due to variation of the number of DEGs and the intensity of gene expression, rather than functional differentiation. Further analysis suggested that transcription factors might play pivotal role in determination of the cluster pattern, and that WRKY family were strongly associated with incompatible reactions. Analysis of IRAGs and CRAGs with putative functions suggested that the regulation of many phytohormone signaling pathways were associated with incompatible or compatible interactions with potential crosstalk between each other. As such, our study provides an in depth view of both incompatible and compatible interactions between soybean and P. sojae, which provides further insight into the mechanisms involved in host-pathogen interactions.

While research has advanced our understanding of plant responses to long-term nutrient deficiencies, less is known about the signaling pathways and immediate responses to certain nutrient deficiencies, such as Pi and Fe deficiencies. Recent studies have shown that sucrose acts as a long-distance signal that is sent in increased concentrations from the shoot to the root in response to various nutrient deficiencies. Here, we mimicked nutrient deficiency-induced sucrose signaling by adding sucrose directly to the roots. To unravel transcriptomic responses to sucrose acting as a signal, we performed Illumina RNA-sequencing of soybean roots treated with sucrose for 20 min and 40 min, compared to non-sucrose-treated controls. We obtained a total of 260 million paired-end reads, mapping to 61,675 soybean genes, some of which are novel (not yet annotated) transcripts. Of these, 358 genes were upregulated after 20 min, and 2416 were upregulated after 40 min of sucrose exposure. GO (gene ontology) analysis revealed a high proportion of sucrose-induced genes involved in signal transduction, particularly hormone, ROS (reactive oxygen species), and calcium signaling, in addition to regulation of transcription. In addition, GO enrichment analysis indicates that sucrose triggers crosstalk between biotic and abiotic stress responses.

Here we reported that an Alfin1-like soybean protein, GmPHD6, read H3K4me0/1/2 but not H3K4me3 with the N-terminal instead of the PHD finger. GmPHD6 does not possess transcriptional regulatory ability. Through the PHD finger, GmPHD6 interacts with its co-activator, LHP1-1/2. Using a transgenic hairy root system, we demonstrated that over-expression of GmPHD6 improved stress tolerance in transgenic soybean composites. Perhaps due to the excessive amount of LHP1 compared to that of GmPHD6, over-expression of LHP1-1/2 failed to do so. The integrity of the complex is essential in stress response, for the abrogation of DNA binding activity of GmPHD6 or the decrease of LHP1 content leads to stress sensitivity in soybean. GmPHD6 influences expression of dozens of stress-related genes to confer stress tolerance. Among these genes, we identified three direct targets of GmPHD6, ASR (ABA-stress-ripening induced), CYP71A22 (cytochrome P450) and CYP82C4. Our study reveals significant findings in stress response. GmPHD6 and LHP1 are recruited to H3K4me0/1/2 marks, where several stress-related genes may locate in, to form a transcriptional activation complex. GmPHD6 locates target sites through recognizing the G-rich elements in their promoters; LHP1 enhances expression levels of these targets. Genetically engineering of GmPHD6/LHP1 complex should improve stress tolerance in crop plants.

Here, we report small RNA sequencing of ten stages of seed development from a few days post fertilization through maturity, revealing the amplification from primary to secondary short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) occurring during development. The young seed populations had a higher proportion of siRNAs representing the CHS1-3-4 gene family members, consistent with this region as the origin of the primary siRNAs. More intriguingly, the very young seed had a higher proportion of 22-nt CHS siRNAs than did the mid-maturation seed. We infer that the primary CHS siRNAs increase during development to levels sufficient to trigger amplification of secondary CHS siRNAs from the CHS7/8 target mRNAs, enabling the total levels of 21-nt CHS siRNAs to rise dramatically. Further, we demonstrate that the soybean system exhibits tissue-specific CHS siRNA production because primary CHS siRNA levels are not sufficient to trigger secondary amplification in tissues other than the seed coat.

Soybean (Glycine max) is especially ozone sensitive, and research into its response to oxidative stress is limited. To better understand the genetic response in soybean to oxidative stress, an RNA-seq analysis of two soybean cultivars was performed comparing an ozone intolerant cultivar and an ozone resistant cultivar after being exposed to ozone. A cursory analysis of the transcriptome data revealed differences between cultivars in the expression levels of genes previously implicated in oxidative stress responses, indicating unique cultivar-specific responses. An examination of the timing of gene responses over the course of ozone exposure showed expression of cuticle wax genes in the intolerant line over all sampled time points, whereas the tolerant line only expressed this pathway in the first time point. The ozone tolerant cultivar has a thicker leaf structure and we believe this lends a passive benefit to the plant which the intolerant cultivar is attempting to supplement via cuticle wax synthesis. These results suggest that differences in genetic responses work in concert with physiological differences to explain differences in ozone tolerance between soybean cultivars.

Soybean GmFATA1 and GmFATA2 are homoeologous genes encoding oleoyl-ACP thioesterases whose role in seed oil accumulation and plant growth has not been defined. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing mutation of Gmfata1 or 2 led to reduced leaf FA content and growth defect at the early seedling stage. In contrast, no homozygous double mutants were obtained. Combined this indicates that GmFATA1 and GmFATA2 display overlapping, but not complete functional redundancy. Combined transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis revealed a large number of genes involving in FA synthesis and FA chain elongation are expressed at reduced level in the Gmfata1 mutant, accompanied by a lower triacylglycerol abundance at the early seedling stage. Further analysis showed that the Gmfata1 or 2 mutants had increased composition of the beneficial FA, oleic acid. The growth defect of Gmfata1 could be at least partially attributed to reduced Acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, reduced abundance of five unsaturated monogalactosyldiacylglycerol lipids, and altered chloroplast morphology.

RNA was sequenced from seven different stages of seed development, yielding between 12 million and 78 million sequenced transcripts. These have been aligned to the 79,000 gene models predicted from the soybean genome recently sequenced by the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. Over one hundred gene models were identified with high expression exclusively in young seed stages, starting at just four days after fertilization. These were annotated as being related to many basic components and processes such as histones and proline-rich proteins. Genes involved with some storage proteins such as glycinin and beta-conglycinin had their highest expression levels at the stages of largest fresh weight, confirming previous knowledge that these storage products are being rapidly accumulated before the seed begins the desiccation process. Other gene models showed high expression in the dry, mature seeds, perhaps indicating the preparation of pathways needed later, in the early stages of imbibition. Many highly-expressed gene models at the dry seed stage are, as expected, annotated as hydrophilic proteins associated with low water conditions, such as late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and dehydrins, which help preserve the cellular structures and nutrients within the seed during desiccation. Hundreds of transcription factors with notable expression in at least one stage of seed development were also identified and examined. Results from a second biological replicate demonstrate high reproducibility of these data.

In this study, we focused on NAC and YABBY transcription factors which showed a conspicuous expression pattern during soybean seedling development.

BSR symptoms are often confused with other soybean diseases or nutrient stress, making it difficult to characterize and deploy resistance in soybean breeding programs. Different genetic studies have suggest BSR resistance could be controlled by a single gene or as many as three tightly linked genes, all located on the same interval of chromosome 16. This interval contains 107 receptor-like proteins (RLPs), similar to disease resistance genes characterized from other species. The RLPs are arranged in distinct clusters, each with different sequence signature. To gain insight into BSR resistance mechanisms, we took advantage of virus induced gene silencing, which allowed us to turn off different RLP clusters or cluster combinations. If a cluster was required for resistance, turning it off would result in resistant plants that became susceptible to BSR. Using this approach we identified two clusters that are required for resistance to BSR in a line carrying the Rbs1 resistance gene. Using whole genome expression analyses, we developed a network of genes regulated by the two clusters of RLPs to confer resistance.'}"

In addition, genes with potential additive and non-additive effects were identified in two mapping lines, several of these with a potential function in the control of the innate immunity. Likewise, we observed that some genes differentially expressed across the parental and mapping lines showed different DNA methylation patterns.

Small RNA sequencing of dissected regions of immature seed coats demonstrated that CHS siRNA levels cause the patterns produced by the i-i and i-k alleles of the I locus, which restrict pigment to the hilum or saddle region of the seed coat, respectively. To identify the K1 locus, we compared RNA-Seq data from dissected regions of two Clark isolines having similar saddle phenotypes mediated by CHS siRNAs but different genotypes (homozygous i-k K1 versus homozygous i-i k1). By examining differentially expressed genes, mapping information, and genome resequencing, we identified a 129-bp deletion in Glyma.11G190900 encoding Argonaute5 (AGO5), a member of the Argonaute family. Amplicon sequencing of several independent saddle pattern mutants from different genetic backgrounds revealed independent lesions affecting AGO5, thus establishing Glyma.11G190900 as the K1 locus. Non-functional AGO5 from k1 alleles leads to altered distributions of CHS siRNAs, thus explaining how the k1 mutation reverses the phenotype of the seed coat regions from yellow to pigmented, even in the presence of the normally dominant I or i-i alleles.

However, very little information is available on the adaptive mechanisms, particularly in the important legume crop soybean (Glycine Max L.), which enable leaves to respond to high-Mn availability. Thus, to elucidate these mechanisms in soybean leaves at molecular level, we used an RNA sequencing approach to investigate transcriptomes of the leaves under Mn-sufficient and Pi-excessive conditions. Our investigation revealed that more genes showed altered expression patterns in old leaf than in young leaf under Mn excess, suggesting that the Mn excess-more-sensitive old leaf required expression change in a larger number of genes to cope with high-Mn stress than the Mn excess-less-sensitive young leaf. The functional classification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was examined to gain an understanding of how leaves respond to Mn stress, caused by soil Mn excess. As a result, more DEGs involved in nodulation, detoxification, nutrient/ion transport, transcriptional factors, key metabolic pathways, Mn remobilization and signalling were found in Mn-excessive induced old leaves than in Mn-excessive induced young leaves. Our findings have enabled the identification of molecular processes that play important roles in the acclimation of leaves to Mn excess, ultimately leading to the development of Mn-efficient soybean suitable for Mn-excessive soils. Overall design: The experiment was started at the onset of the fifth leaf stage when the plants were transferred to solutions with either normal (5 μM) or high (100 μM) Mn (added as MnSO4).

The net pattern mutation creates breaks in the seed coat of soybean (Glycine max) because of ruptured cell walls. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the seed coat transcriptome from three stages of immature seed development in two pairs of isolines with normal or defective seed coat phenotypes due to the net pattern. The genome-wide comparative study of the transcript profiles of these isolines revealed 364 differentially expressed genes in common between the two varieties that were further divided into different broad functional categories. Genes related to cell wall processes accounted for 19% of the differentially expressed genes in the middle developmental stage of 100-200 mg seed weight. Within this class, the cell wall proline-rich and glycine-rich protein genes were highly differentially expressed in both genetic backgrounds. Other genes that showed significant expression changes in each of the isoline pairs at the 100-200 mg seed weight stage were xylem serine proteinase, fasciclin-related genes, auxin and stress response related genes, TRANSPARENT TESTA 1 (TT1) and other transcription factors. The mutant appears to shift the timing of either the increase or decrease in the levels of some of the transcripts. The analysis of these data sets reveals the physiological changes that the seed coat undergoes during the formation of the breaks in the cell wall.

There are two major components of this disease: (i) root necrosis and (ii) foliar SDS. Root symptoms consist of root necrosis with vascular discoloration that extends upto several nodes and internodes into the stem. Foliar SDS symptom is characterized by interveinal chlorosis and necrosis in leaves which finally curl and fall off, and in severe cases by flower, pod abscission and immature seed formation. A major toxin involved in initiating foliar SDS has been identified. Nothing is known about how root necrosis develops. In order to unravel the mechanisms used by the pathogen to cause root necrosis, the transcriptome of the pathogen in infected soybean root tissues of a susceptible cultivar (Williams 82) was investigated. The transcriptomes of the germinating conidia and mycelia were also examined. Of the 14,845 predicted F. virguliforme genes, we observed that 12,017 (81%) were expressed in germinating conidial spores and 12,208 (82%) in mycelia and 10,626 (72%) in infected soybean roots. Of the 10,626 genes induced in infected roots, 224 were transcribed only following infection. Expression of several infection-induced genes encoding enzymes with oxidation-reduction properties suggests that degradation of antimicrobial compounds such as the phytoalexin, glyceollin could be important in establishing the biotrophic phase. Enzymes with hydrolytic and catalytic activities could play an important role in the transitioning of the pathogen from biotrophic to necrotrophic phase. Expression of a large number of genes encoding enzymes with catalytic and hydrolytic activities during late infection stage suggests cell wall degradation by some of these enzymes could be involved in root necrosis and establishing the necrotrophic phase in this pathogen. Overall design: RNA-seq data for Fusarium virguliforme Mont-1 germinating conidial spores, mycelia and soybean root tissue 3 and 5 days or 10 and 24 days post water incubation or infection with Fusarium virguliforme Mont-1 conidial spores.

The SKRPs are novel proteins that associate with spliceosome components, and are negative regulators of plant immunity. Analysis by RNA-seq data indicates that alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs from 401 soybean genes, including defense related genes, is altered in GmSKRP1 and PsAvr3c over-expressing lines compared to control plants. Representative splicing events mediated by GmSKRP1 and PsAvr3c are tested by infection assays or by transient expression in soybean plants. Our results show that a plant pathogen effector can reprogram host pre-mRNA splicing to promote disease, and we propose that pathogens evolved such strategies to defeat host immune systems.

Previous studies have identified certain WRKY transcription factors, which confer Cd tolerance in different plant species. In the present study, we have identified 29 Cd-responsive WRKY genes in Edamame [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and confirmed that 26 of those GmWRKY genes were up-regulated, while 3 were down-regulated. We have also cloned the novel, positively regulated GmWRKY142 gene from soybean and investigated its regulatory mechanism in Cd tolerance. GmWRKY142 was highly expressed in the root, drastically up-regulated by Cd, localized in the nucleus, and displayed transcriptional activity. The overexpression of GmWRKY142 in Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean hairy roots significantly enhanced Cd tolerance and lead to extensive transcriptional reprogramming of stress-responsive genes. ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 encoding cadmium tolerance 1 were induced in overexpression lines. Further analysis showed that GmWRKY142 activated the transcription of ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 by directly binding to the W-box element in their promoters. In addition, the functions of GmCDT1-1 and GmCDT1-2, responsible for decreasing Cd uptake, were validated by heterologous expression in A. thaliana. Our combined results have determined GmWRKYs to be newly discovered participants in response to Cd stress, and have confirmed that GmWRKY142 directly targets ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 to decrease Cd uptake and positively regulate Cd tolerance. The GmWRKY142-GmCDT1-1/2 cascade module provides a potential strategy to lower Cd accumulation in Edamame.'}"

Its possible function in plants is less clear. In the present study, we tested the effect of melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) on soybean growth and development. Both spraying of leaves and seed-coating with melatonin significantly promoted soybean growth as judged from leaf size and plant height. This enhancement was also observed in soybean production and their fatty acid content. Melatonin increased pod number, seed number and seed weight. However, the 100-seed weight was not influenced by melatonin application. Melatonin also improved soybean tolerance to salt and drought stresses. Transcriptome analysis revealed that melatonin up-regulated the expression of many genes and alleviated the inhibitory effects of salt stress on gene expressions. Further detailed analysis of the affected pathways documents that melatonin likely achieved its promotional roles in soybean through enhancement of genes involved in cell division, photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and ascorbate metabolism. Our results demonstrate that melatonin has significant potential for improving of soybean growth and seed production. Further study should uncover more about the molecular mechanisms of melatonin’s function in soybeans and other crops.

Several management practices are implemented to mitigate yield losses caused by SCN, including using SDHI (succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors) fungicides delivered as seed treatments. A set of studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of two seed-applied succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHI) compounds, fluopyram and pydiflumetofen, on SCN population densities, plant injury, and plant growth. Cyst counts in untreated control and pydiflumetofen treated plants were 3.44 and 3.59 times higher than fluopyram, respectively, while egg counts were 8.25 and 7.06 times higher in control and pydiflumetofen. Next-generation sequencing was later employed to identify transcriptomic shifts in gene expression profiles in fluopyram and pydiflumetofen -treated seedlings. RNA expression patterns of seed treatments clustered by sampling time (5 DAP vs. 10 DAP); therefore, downstream analysis was conducted by timepoint. At 5 DAP, 10,870 and 325 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified in fluopyram and pydiflumetofen, respectively. These same treatments generated 219 and 2 DEGs at 10 DAP. Multiple DEGs identified in soybean seedlings treated with fluopyram are linked to systemic resistance, suggesting a potential role of systemic resistance in the suppression of SCN by fluopyram, in addition to the known nematicidal activity. The non-target inhibition of soybean succinate dehydrogenase genes by fluopyram may be the origin of the phytotoxicity symptoms observed and potentially the source of the systemic resistance activation reported in the current study. This work helps to elucidate the mechanisms of suppression of SCN by fluopyram.'}"

Discovery and analysis of sequence and expression variations in these genes will accelerate soybean oil quality improvement. In an effort to identify these variations, we sequenced the transcriptomes of soybean seeds from nine lines varying in oil composition and/or total oil content. Our results showed that 69,338 distinct transcripts from 32,885 annotated genes were expressed in seeds. A total of 8,037 transcript expression polymorphisms and 50,485 transcript sequence polymorphisms (48,792 SNPs and 1,693 small Indels) were identified among the lines. Effects of the transcript polymorphisms on their encoded protein sequences and functions were predicted. The studies also provided independent evidence that the lack of FAD2-1A gene activity and a non-synonymous SNP in the coding sequence of FAB2C caused elevated oleic acid and stearic acid levels in soybean lines M23 and FAM94-41, respectively. As a proof-of-concept, we developed an integrated RNA-seq and bioinformatics approach to identify and functionally annotate transcript polymorphisms, and demonstrated its high effectiveness for discovery of genetic and transcript variations that result in altered oil quality traits. The collection of transcript polymorphisms coupled with their predicted functional effects will be a valuable asset for further discovery of genes, gene variants, and functional markers to improve soybean oil quality.

TasiRNAs have not been extensively described in many plant species. We identified dozens of new miRNAs in Medicago and soybean and confirmed 119 Medicago targets. A search for phased tasiRNA-like small RNAs ('phasiRNAs') found at least 114 Medicago loci, the majority of which were NB-LRR encoding genes. Notably, conserved domains in NB-LRR-encoding RNAs are targeted by several 22-nt miRNA families to trigger phasiRNA production. DCL2 and SGS3 transcripts were also cleaved by these 22-nt miRNAs, generating phased small RNAs, suggesting synchronization between silencing and pathogen defense pathways. A second example of 'two-hit' phasiRNA processing was identified, utilizing miR156-miR172 sites. Our data illustrate a complex tasiRNA-mediated regulatory circuit that potentially modulates plant-microbe interactions. A few miRNA triggers regulate an extremely large gene family by targeting highly conserved protein motif-encoding sequences, representing a new paradigm for miRNA function.

Among these bi-ostimulants, living yeast-based biostimulants are also commercialized. Given the living aspect of these products, the reproducibility of their effects should be investigated to ensure end-users’ confidence in these solutions. This study aimed to compare effects of a living yeast-based bi-ostimulant between two different soybean cultures. These two cultures C1 and C2 were con-ducted on the same variety and soil, but in different locations and dates until VC developmental stage (unifoliate leaves unrolled), with and without biostimulant treatment on seeds. A leaf transcriptomic analysis was conducted in order to characterize the biostimulant effect on these two cultures. This study firstly showed a high gene expression difference between the two cul-tures. Despite this first result, a secondary analysis focusing on the different pathways differen-tially expressed with the biostimulant treatment showed that pathways modulated by the bi-ostimulant treatment were really close between soybean cultures C1 and C2. These results seem to show that the biostimulant effects led to a similar pathway enhancement in plants even if genes expression was different between the two cultures. Pathways which seems to be reproducibly impacted by the living yeast based biostimulant are abiotic stress response, carbohydrate syn-thesis, protein metabolism and glycolysis.'}"

DGE data and RNA-Seq data were mapped to the cDNAs (Glyma models) predicted from the reference soybean genome, Williams 82. Extending the model length by 250 bp at both ends resulted in significantly more matches of authentic DGE tags indicating that many of the predicted gene models are prematurely truncated at the 5’ and 3’ UTRs. The genome-wide comparative study of the transcript profiles of the wild-type versus mutant line revealed a number of differentially expressed genes. One highly-expressed gene, Glyma04g35130, in wild-type soybean was of interest as it has high homology to the cotton gene GhRDL1 gene that has been identified as being involved in cotton fiber initiation and is a member of the BURP protein family. Sequence comparison of Glyma04g35130 among Williams 82 with our sequences derived from CS and CG isolines revealed various SNPs and indels including addition of one nucleotide C in the CG and insertion of ~60 bp in the third exon of CS that causes a frameshift mutation and premature truncation of peptides in both lines as compared to Williams 82.

Deploying soybean cultivars carrying race-specific resistance conferred by Rps genes is the most practicalapproach to managing this disease. Previously, two Rps genes, RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 conferring broad spectra of resistance to P. sojae isolates, were identified in a landrace PI 567139B and mapped to a 6.5-cM region on chromosome 3 and a 3.0-cM region on chromosome 16, corresponding to 840 kb and 600 kb of sequences, respectively,of the soybean reference genome. By analyzing ten and nine recombinants defined by genotypic and phenotypic screening of the 826 F2:3 families derived from two reciprocal crosses between the two parental lines of the mapping populations, RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 were further narrowed to a 151-kb region that harbors five genes including three NBS-LRR genes, and a 36-kb region that contains four genes including five NBS-LRR genes, respectively, according to the reference genome. Analysis of expressional changes of these nine genes before and after inoculation with the pathogen suggest that the counterparts of Glyma.03g034600 in the RpsUN1 region and the counterparts of Glyma.16g215200 and Glyma.16g214900 in the RpsUN2 region of PI 567139B may be associated with the resistance to P. sojae. It is also suggested that unequal recombination between different NBS-LRR genes in the mapped regions may have occurred, resulting in the formation of two recombinants with inconsistent genotypes and phenotypes detected by molecular markers within the fine-mapped regions. The haplotypes of genomic regions surrounding RpsUN1 and RpsUN2 in the entire soybean germplasm deposited in the US soybean germplasm collection were analyzed towards a better understanding of the origins of these two novel sources of resistance and screening of effective markers for marker-assisted selectionof these two resistance genes for soybean breeding. Overall design: 2 samples were sequenced, 1 inoculated with P. sojae, the other 1 were mock-inoculated'}"

After being attacked by herbivores, multiple signaling patheways will be triggered in plants, which induces the production of toxic, repellent, or anti-digestive compounds. Genetic engineering and breeding of resistant plant lines are the most effective and environmentally friendly approaches to control herbivores and improve the performance of plants. This study focuses on founding changes genes and proteins in soybean defense response induced by H. armigera. Illumina Solexa sequencing platform and iTRAQ were used for the comparative analysis of transcriptome and proteome profiles in the leaves of Tianlong 2 (a cultivated soybean susceptible to herbivores) and ED059 (a wild soybean resistant to herbivores) in response to infestation by H. armigera. Transcriptome data show that 2073 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were uniquely expressed in ED059 compared with those in Tianlong 2 after 24 h of H. armigera treatment. Based on gene ontology classification of these 2073 DEGs, we identified 233 DEGs corresponded to various signaling pathways, including protein kinases, transcriptional factors, hormone biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways. In addition, a large number of genes related to antinutritive or toxic proteins were special induced in ED059. By combining the gene expression at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, results reveal that no significantly high correlation was detected between the expression of mRNAs and proteins. Functional analysis of three candidate genes was accomplished by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in Arabidopsis thaliana, and a MYB transcription factor 109 (MYB109) was identified with herbivore defense function in ED059. This study provides insights into the identification of the potential genes and proteins involved in herbivore defense, and a possible understanding of the herbivore defense mechanism in a wild soybean by combining analysis of transcriptome and proteome data. Moreover, a novel gene associated with herbivore resistance function was identified and validated. Overall design: Totally four samples, two treatments and two genotypes.'}"

PRJNA141239,"{'name': 'Digital gene expression profiling of the Phytophthora sojae transcriptome', 'title': 'Digital gene expression profiling of the Phytophthora sojae transcriptome', 'description': ""The transcriptome of the oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora sojae was profiled at 10 different developmental and infection stages based on a 3'-tag digital gene expression (DGE) protocol. More than 90 million clean sequence tags were generated and compared to the P. sojae genome and its 19,027 predicted genes. A total of 14,969 genes were detected, of which 10,044 were deemed reliable because they mapped to unambiguous tags. A comparison of the whole-library genes expression patterns suggested four groups: 1) mycelia and zoosporangia (MY and SP); 2) zoospores and cysts (ZO and CY); 3) germinating cysts (GC); 4) five infection site libraries (IF1.5 to IF24h). The libraries from the different groups showed major transitional shifts in gene expression. From the ten libraries, 722 gene expression pattern clusters were obtained and the top 16 ones, containing more than half of the genes, comprised enriched genes with different functions including protein localization, triphosphate metabolism, signaling process, and non-coding RNA metabolism. An evaluation of the average expression level of 30 pathogenesis related gene families revealed that most were infection induced, but with diverse expression patterns and levels. A web-based server named the Phytophthora Transcriptional Database (PTD) has been established. Overall design: The five axenically grown stages were mycelia (MY), zoosporangia (SP), zoospores (ZO), cysts (CY), and germinating cysts (GC). The five infection stages, 1.5, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after inoculation onto susceptible soybean leaf tissues (IF1.5h to IF24h)."", 'doi': '21848399'}"
